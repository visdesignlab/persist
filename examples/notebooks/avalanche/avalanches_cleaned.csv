Partner bailed but still went out today with the intent of exploring around Catherine's Pass just to take a look and take one ride out using the low angle terrain near the trail to the pass to get back down to the meadow. Started at 12:30 and got to the pass at 3:00. Since it stopped snowing and began to clear, decided to skin up to the ridgeline for a better view.  Dug 3 pits, one prior in the meadow just for curiosity’s sake, another along the ridge and another towards what I believed to be the top of the run ‘so long’.  After these assessments, it was apparent riding any of these open slopes could be a bad play. By the time I was at what I perceived to be ‘so long’ it was snowing pretty well again and the fatigue that had set in had begun to cloud my judgment. Instead of taking the time to simply use my own skin track back to the meadow, figured I could save time and energy by riding or just hiking down the spine. (Looker’s right of 'so long' utilizing all the trees as anchors.) 

As I started down, I didn’t locate the specific trees I had seen several times before and then realized I was not near so long but actually on sunset, which starts out at even lower angle but has a short, steep section for what I believe was about 20-30 yards to get to the meadow. Attempted 3 turns to release any sluff which it did and released a good bit of snow to my right. So had let that pass and attempted to change direction to exit to my left by crossing the slope and once I did, it released about 5 or so yards above me and was easily able to stop and let the snow pass without issue. 

Took only one photo which is attached and surprised how far it had continued to my left. Again, a bad estimate on distance but would guess 60-80 yards? Rode down to the meadow and out but think about the following mistakes. (1) Should have never been on that north facing slope, especially being well aware of the advisory and previous snow still in place, (2) solo, (3) deviated from original plan, (4) used fatigue and time constraints as an excuse to not backtrack safely, (5) knowingly going into a short, but potential terrain trap, (6) changing direction after releasing the sluff. 

Thought it was important to report and get the appropriate feedback. 

Forecaster Comments:  Excellent perspective on the event.  Thank you for submitting the observation.  Should inspire others heading out over the weekend that avalanche season has begun."

      1st collapse ; treed, north facing, 9900',  with two skier tracks 50' away, no avalanche.
      2nd collapse; partially open terrain (obvious slide path), with trees marking the flanks, northwest, 10300', avalanche.  The slide released 40' down slope where the angle increased, approx. 39 degrees.  The collapse happened on a 20 degree or less angle. Size D2, 100'X3'X200'vert., old snow facets 1.5mm., full depth.
     3rd collapse; open terrain, north, 10450', avalanche.  This was triggered 50' downslope from the ridge, with a similar slope angle as the first slide.  We could not see the depth of the crown from our vantage point, but it's fair to say 3-4'deep, full depth. D2, 60'X3-4'X 700'vert., old snow facets.
     4th collapse; third skier on slope, open terrain, 10350', north, avalanche.  The slope angle was approx. 30 degrees or less.  This was the most significant collapse and avalanche , as this produced at least five slides at different elevations and fracture widths with the widest crown approx. 1000' wide, aspects N-NW. Lake Catherine was hit by debris.  
      Just a couple of side notes.  Our party knew the avalanche hazard for today.  We knew the terrain that we were in. We knew this seasons snow pack history, on going new snow totals, and snow pack structure .  We put the skin track in and monitored it visually to keep tabs on other users.  One other person used it up to Catherine pass.  We did not drop in until the other user was at the pass.  We kept our slope angle low and identified safe spots.  We had good visibility, the run out zone was clear should an avalanche happen.  We thought we would kick a slide off, but we were a bit surprised to see how well the soft slab was connected.  With hard slab failure it is not uncommon to see crowns travel long distances through non uniform terrain, soft slabs however not so much in non uniform terrain.  The snow felt right side up, no wind effect, 4 finger to fist resistance, not very supportable, we could barely make turns on the low angle slope we skied.  We had less than a dozen good turns for the day based on the terrain we chose to ski in/ be in, but we did it safely.

I was deliberately ski cutting the top of this slope when a 10' wide, 1' deep, very soft slab released at my feet, running into the choke of the gully below me.  Below the narrowest portion of this slope, the weight of the debris released a wider avalanche below cliff bands on either side of the narrows.  On the skier's right side of this sympathetic release, the slab failed in pooled graupel that likely accumulated during one of the graupel events in the latter half of this week, and the crown in this portion of the slide was about 16 inches deep; on the skiers left side, a 20-foot wide, 2' soft slab failed on the faceted snow that sat atop the snowpack for several weeks in mid/late November.  The debris from this slide entrained quite a bit of snow, ran until the slope angle decreased significantly, and could have buried a person.  Although it was a crowded day in Silver/Days, nobody was in the area when this slide occurred.  

This slide occurred during what was likely the peak of instability during a day of moderate-heavy snowfall.  Several density changes were noted throughout the day, with heavily rimed flakes and clean, angular stellars falling in consecutive periods.  What initially seemed like a short, manageable portion of complex terrain worth navigating in order to harvest the pow-pow below, was in immediate hindsight a perfect spot to activate a couple of distinct buried weak layers.  The ""November Facets,"" which have lacked a sufficient load to propagate clean shears in snowpit tests, showed their potential with the help of significant shock-loading, and I would not be surprised if additional snow-n-blow overnight makes avalanches failing on this layer-as well as wind slabs and storm snow avalanches failing on buried graupel or various crusts-easier to trigger tommorow.  I would consider midslope terrain features, on NW-N-NE facing slopes above about 10,000', which may have been sheltered during recent wind/rain events, to be most suspicious for possible persistent slab avalanches.

I reported this slide to Alta Central, and it was in turn reported to the UAC, as a 1' deep, 50 foot wide avalanche.  Drew's snowpit is an accurate representation of the snowpack I found in the crown of this slide.  "

We were easily able to get onto the bed surface without having any hangfire above us.  The weakness revolved around the rain crusts from the 4th and the 5th of December, which, now have some faceted grains around them.  The avalanche did not break into the deeper November facets.
Earlier in the day we looked at two other recent avalanches on Square Top along the Park City Ridgeline.  Because of the wind and drifting snow we were not able to positively identify which weak layer failed there.  After we triggered Little Water and considering Ev's avalanche on Reynolds on the 9th which both broke around the rain crusts, we are assuming that Square Top had the same weak layer.
The deal here is that the northwest winds formed a significant enough slab on the east facing slopes.  North slopes were not wind loaded enough.  We suspect that above around 9600' or 9800' the rain crust is not present and the danger is less pronounced.  It seems that east facing slopes along ridges which have just been wind loaded and are sitting between 8500 and 9500 feet is where the hazard is.

Prior to the event, party of three experienced some collapsing during the ascent and evidence of natural sluffing.

We had not seen any natural activity early in the week, and found no evidence today, but as we drove over the Miller Flat to check and clear interval board and total stake, I noticed this from the road.  We had skied right here 2 weeks ago, so see that ob for a profile at that time.  I suspect this was triggered on lookers right by a snowmobile (judging from the tracks) a couple of days ago.  While no natural activity had been observed just after the storm, we suspected there had to be pockets that all the parts were in place, and this confirms that idea.  It obviously took more than just loading, like a snowmobile, but things have had a couple more days of strengthening, so the landmines out there will be that much more stubborn.
This is a small terrain feature, a ways off the main ridgeline, and protected by trees on the west.  The typical constant wind had loaded this area and produced the isolated pockety results.

Chase's analysis of the slide was that ESE winds from the day before loaded the slope using the island of trees as a snow fence.  The thick part of the slab was clearly skiers right while the thin part was skiers left near where the boarder was riding.  There were tracks going into the thick part of the slab as well as at least 2 sets going into the thin part of the slab.  The slope had been skied by at least 3 people.  Also to note there was a pocket within the slope that had already pulled out.  This pocket was within the new snow only.  With out access to the site after the slide I cannot say if the slope failed on the rain crust about 80cm down or if the slope failed near the ground.  The pictures I took clearly show rocks poking through the snow pack suggesting possibly that the slope failed below the rain crust sandwiches but that may just be a local phenomenom.

These types of avalanches will be unmanageable and could be triggered from a distance. Best to avoid steepE, N, NE, NW facing slopes steeper than 30 degrees in steepness. Slopes that face the southern half of the compass are generally a safer bet.
Great riding conditions with a supportable base, but don't let that trick you into thinking slopes are stable. The main problem is the extremely weak snow that is now buried 2-4 feet deep in places. Its a house of cards out there right now, its just waiting to come crashing down. The avalanches will be large enough to bury or seriously injury you.
Boondocking in the rock free meadows is the safest bet for now. We avoided all avalanche terrain today, and will do the same for tomorrow's outing. This is a patience game, and right now we need to have some patience and leave the hills alone.

Upslope winds transported snow from the lower angle meadows below into the bottom of a minor chute between the Hallway Couloir and Holy Toledo. The initial release also triggered a slide on a rock slab to skiers right, which pulled out to the ground. The avalanche ran about 150 vertical feet into trees, with several barrel sized blocks still intact. The instability seemed relatively isolated to the bottom of the chute and the slope below, where extensive hollow hard slabs are sitting on large faceted grains.

		There had been a human triggered slide in the area the day before.  They felt that they could head over toward that slide to use as an area of safety if a slide was triggered.
	
		The first skier did a hand pit and found only 6-8"" of snow above the facets and felt that any avalanche would not be that big.  Unfortunately this was not representative of the depth at the crown.  
	
		The 1st two skiers skied the slope without incident.
	
		They found no cracking or significant collapsing on route.
	
		They were all excellent skiers/riders with a good deal of knowledge of snow and avalanche mechanics...but as the individual mostly buried confided to me - ""We didn't see the forest for the trees.  The big picture was that there was weak snow buried by a big storm on a steep avalanche prone slope with the danger as Considerable.  What else is there to know?""  I think he hits the nail on the head here.  Sometimes our experience/education can give us a laundry list of reasons to ride a dangerous slope that we want to ride while ignoring the bull's eye clues.

There was new snow on the debris (a dusting) equal to what had fallen Saturday. Maybe west winds Friday formed a wind slab that dropped  and started it? With a safe place for an up track and no hangfire, we proceeded up and skied the left flank of the slide. Snow was super slow due to cold temps and some clinkers in there.

Forecaster's Note: Noise does not trigger avalanches but it is possible for the rotor wash of the helicopter to trigger avalanches in rare cases.  Since many wet snow sluffs were coming down naturally all day long, it's also possible that this is a natural wet, point-release that came off the rocks at the same time. "

Intentionally triggered a hard slab on a regular repeater that top loads with southwesterly winds.  It's located in an area that has mellow terrain above and then breaks over onto steeper slopes with trees, brush and terrain traps below.  I rarely dive into this breakover without a slopecut because that's the way I usually hike back out since it's the least exposed compared to other alternatives.  That paid off today.  Slope cut was made at speed from skier's left to right to an island of safety on a shallow angle ridge.  Slope propagated out after second downweighting during slope cut.  Watched the slide from the island of safety where it slowed and then stopped in shallower terrain.  Continued boarding down another 300 vertical and then hiked back up to inspect the slide.  Hard slab was 1Finger to pencil hardness.  The slab propagated up slope pulling out shallower terrain above, 29 degrees.  Tried to isolate a column.  Column broke on backcut, quality 1, sudden planar failing on rounding facets just below 4 finger hardness, 1 inch thick rime crust.

This slide encompassed several paths and terrain traps i.e. cliff bands and road cuts running a long vertical distance over a short path (likely running fairly fast based on its run-out distance on flat ground. It had a deep deposition pile that nearly covered the whole trail/road. There were a dozen or so of similar slides on the north facing aspects in the canyon and a substantial amount of roller balls and pin wheels on the south facing slopes, but no slides likely because of the lack of snow prior to the last storm cycle.

Looking on the fetch to the south, a significant row of trees may be a catalyst for this path, slowing the snow so it loaded on this steep rocky gullies ,  and while several other exposed ridgelines had been blown to the dirt from SW winds, that was not the case here.  This is the only activity we saw all day long, where we skiied is included in our ob. 

Obviously faceting in the rocks is the weak layer, the pictures tell it all.  Recent wind loading yesterday and overnight, failed on facets in rocky shallow area. 

FORECASTER COMMENTS:  Darce is on it here.  I've noted numerous areas where the wind has stripped the snow creating a shallow snowpack that is much weaker than the deeper areas.  This is tricky as these shallow areas become buried and there are no obvious signs that they are holding a shallow and weak snowpack under the newer snow.  The only way is to follow certain slopes throughout the winter so you know what the structure is and how it progresses.  Otherwise, it's a 'crap shoot'.  I am also a bit surprised to see natural activity but the winds no doubt picked up enough to transports snow on Sunday.

The total snow height was 240 cm at the middle of the main crown. The slide occurred with collapse failure of the upper crust of the crust/facet/crust sandwich. Facets between these crusts were .5 mm to 1 mm and angular with some exhibiting visible striations.This part of the avalanche propagated 85 feet wide, and ranged from 30 cm to 40 cm deep. The failing upper crust ranged from 1 cm to 3 cm thick. The left flank of this part of the slide appeared to be the main failure point, and the total snow height at this failure point was no more than 70 cm deep. The location and width of this slide was almost identical to the previous slide here on 1/28/13. This slide was much shallower than the previous slide, though after looking at the snowpack structure the buried persistent weak layer from the initial (1/28/13) deep persistent hard slab avalanche is still lingering. OF NOTE: Upon investigation, this lower weak layer actually failed and left a gaping crack at the old buried crown face at 75 cm down from the surface. Also of note was the similar way this ""repeater"" propagated out towards the Back Bowls at a lower elevation right where the public traverse has been traveling. The lower propagation was another 65 feet wide; and this area continues to have a very thin weak cover. Where these two parts of the slide intersect appears to be where both the January 28th slide and the February 24th slide were triggered and or initiated. There continues to be a large mostly uncovered  boulder field directly below the main part of the slide; and there is a much safer traverse below this boulder field that leads into the Back Bowls. As noted by the above snowpack profile there are still two significant buried persistent weak layers remaining on this slope; and it appears that they may still become sensitive and reactive with any new significant loading in the future.

It is not uncommon for groups of snowmobilers to get scattered about in play areas but, obviously, this poses a serious risk when someone climbs a steep slope without a partner watching them. The only sure way of staying out of an avalanche is to stay off and out from under all slopes that are 30° in steepness or steeper.  However, many of us, including myself, choose to recreate in avalanche terrain.

One of the methods that I use to reduce my risk is to closely follow the snowpack progression on certain steep slopes throughout the entire winter. This way I am aware of any weak layers that form. I then know if it is safe to get onto these steep slopes after every subsequent snowstorm.

It is a risky endeavor to draw conclusions about a slope with out actually getting on to it and digging into the snow.  This takes a high level of avalanche skill and years of assessing snowpack layering to be able to determine how much new snow and wind a certain slope can withstand before avalanching.

Keeping track of certain slopes may seem unreasonable if you only get out a few times a winter or travel to many different areas.  Also, you can literally get on to hundreds of avalanche slopes in one day on a snowmobile.  How is a person supposed to be able to keep track?  It is near impossible and without knowing the underlying structure of the snowpack, it's a 'crap shoot' getting onto steep avalanche terrain.

A good line of defense if you are going to risk getting into steep terrain is to learn to recognize buried weak sugarary snow and learn to recognize when a slab has formed on top of it.

Conditions on the skin track were fine in the shade, but upon hitting anything in the sun the snow was wet and very sticky.  We did notice a light melt freeze crust in the trees below about 8000 feet presumably from greenhousing.  The mid elevation snow on the north side of the compass seemed great.  After gaining the ridge and seeing pretty significant cornices we decided to cut one to check stability. We were the only party on the skin track up to that point and felt comfortable that no one would be approaching in the area below.  Unable to get anything sizeable to drop from the first cornice without exposing ourselves, we moved on to another more overhanging cornice up the ridge.  Of note with the first cornice, we did remark that the snow surface the smaller chunks landed on did not seem too deep, perhaps a wind slab with some new snow on top.  

The second cornice provided a definative result.  Upon dislodging a chunk in the 300-400 lb. range the slope below avalanched.  The avalanche was interesting in a couple ways.  It was obviously a slope that had been wind loaded, and the intitial fracture looked to be a thick wind slab 1-2.5 feet.  As the slide ran, it looked to dig into the older snow (facets) exposing logs and rocks.  My best guess is that this slope has slid earlier this season leaving a thinner snowpack and well developed facets that the new snow was on top of, but due to hangfire I was not comfortable getting onto the bed surface.  I was able to get close to the toe of the slide, but have already seen what the slope was capable of, it didn't feel the need to explore too much.  The debrie pile was spread out over a 28-29 degree slope about 1-3 ft deep.  Overall the slide was small and probably would not fully bury a person, but the energy and terrain could most certaintly cause severe trauma.  

This was a slope that we were comfortable skiing today before the slide and had in fact sought out due to its elevation and aspect.  I feel that there is a decent chance that if we just dropped the slope we would not have gotten it to slide under the weight of a person.  For myself and my partners today, this is a great learing experience.  By the forecast alone this slope would have fallen into the low category today.  Upon looking at the more sublte signs before going for the center punch we were able to discover a more complex situtation.  The January facets have not gone anywhere, the slope we were looking at had signs of wind loading (obvious from the cornice above, but not on the slope proper).  Ultimately this is a tough situtatation to call.       "

In Maybird, Hogum, and Coalpit Gulch, storm totals since wednesday seem to mirror ski resort study plot data from the upper cottonwoods, with up to a couple feet of light density snow sitting atop the nuclear MF crust from last weekend.  Winds were calm from the NW all day, with sun shining through the low cloud deck occaisionally, but not enough to cause significant wet activity, at least in the higher elevations.  SE-S-W will likely have a slight crust tomorrow.  

Only two significant avalanches were obvious today, in places where you'd expect to see some activity during a windy snowstorm.  Most interesting was a long running, soft-slab avalanche originating in the alluvial feature beneath, and lookers right, of the choke of the upper chute in the Hypodermic Needle--just below where skiers commonly traverse out of the needle and onto the ridgeline between the Coalpit Headwall and the Needle.  This avalanche failed on light density snow from wednesday, 3/20, which sits atop a pencil hard, brown MF crust, and just beneath a 2 inch deep, 1F slab of graupel from thursday morning, 3/21.  Much of the crown was blown in, but a small portion was still exposed, and my best guess is that this slide ran during or just after the period of high precipitation intensity on 3/21.  Debris ran to within a few hundred feet of the creek in Hogum fork, and was covered by new snow from the last few days, and I'd call it a D2.5--your Hummer would have been totaled, but it would still resemble a Hummer.  Debris was still soft underneath ~10"" of new snow, which corroborates my impression that the slide occurred early in this storm cycle.  Another large slide occured in the eastern-most slide path on the coalpit headwall, with impressive deposition apparent ~1500' below the ridgeline.  

No other obvious slides in outer-LCC today, although it is a hoot to see the wet-slide carnage from last weekend just barely obscured by our new snow.

Since thursday, 3/21, I've found the MF crust/stellars/graupel slab combination to continue to be sensitive, with quick snowpits, ski cuts, and cornice drops showing failure propagation in this layering is still possible.  This is certainly a manageable problem, but I'm guessing this weakness will remain active for a few days on isolated terrain features where light density snow from 3/20 sits on top of a MF crust."

I approached the cornice at the top gingerly and knocked off a 30 to 60 lb (i.e. small) piece which subsequently triggered a soft slab roughly 50 ft wide and half a foot deep.  The slide started running, stepped down to entrain most of the storm snow (24inches),  and ran almost full track.  I then performed  a ski cut which pulled out some hang-fire and we skied the soft fluffy debris through the choke and onto the apron where we diverged from depo' to unadulterated snow.  

While re-skinning we observed a skier trigger a decent sized pocket on the southeast periphery of the Two Dog slide track.  The person was able to ski out of harms way below a staunch wall that prevented the skier's right side of the slab from running.

These facets were up to 1mm and were showing signs of rounding. Also, the old snow surface crust in this area was 1 to 2 inches deep and there were moderate sized facets below this crust; and this weakness was just one of three layers that were cracking.  Widespread cracking and collapsing was occurring on all slopes with angles > 30 degrees. Slopes between 30 and 35 degrees were cracking and not moving. All slopes with angles > 35 degrees were either already cleaned out or cracking, and very sensitive and easy to initiate activity. The cracking layers were 4 to 8 inches down, as well as at the old snow surface. Propagation was pronounced and rapid. 
Another avalanche of note was the Wet Slab observed in the lower half of the Main Dog Lake Chute. See photo. This appeared to be human triggered and produced when the snow surface was very wet/damp. The debris pile here was > one meter deep. It appeared that the trigger escaped off the slab to rider's right. This slide was 55 feet wide, 4 to 6 inches deep, and ran only 100 feet to the flats.

I thought 3 shoot was probably a bad idea as  it it is similar aspect and elevation, commented  that we should be very concerned about wind slabs, but I decided """"what does it hurt  to take a look""?  

from the top It ""looked"" good  and I suddenly felt better about it. 

  party of 3,  person # 3 did not enter shoot until after it slide.  

person #1 cut top, no sluff,  person #2 joined and stopped.  person #1 then cut inside the top under a rock on left side of shoot and waited.  person #2 followed same track but stopped 2' below person #1, and it fractured at person #1's feet, or a foot above person #2. person # 2 did not go for a ride, just dropped onto the bed.

the culprit was buried surface hoar , imagine that!
we had skied steeper slopes during the day, although all had has some previous activity as indicated by old debris.
the mistake was not checking for the buried hoar as we had been during all day and assuming that since we had ski cut steeper slopes without debris that this one was not a big deal.  this demonstrates the pockety nature of the surface hoar.  the hangfire was very reactive.  column tests on the crown were very reactive, clean q1 shears on the surface hoar..

One other skier descended the slope next to the one where I triggered this avalanche and they did not trigger anything, although it was the same aspect, elevation and steepness as the small rollover where I triggered the avalanche.  This shows the pockety nature of buried surface hoar.
We saw several natural, shallow, soft slab avalanches at lower elevations along the creek bank in lower Mill D North on steep, east-southeast facing slopes.  These were 6 inches of new snow sliding on a pre-existing sun crust.  I could not find any surface hoar involved but they certainly acted like it.  We saw one slide while skiing up and 3-4 others nearby when we skied down that were not there when we skied up.  There was a high precipitation intensity in the morning, which, no doubt, contributed to the shallow instability. Also, the sun poked out at times, which may have added to the stress."

Good lesson on what can happen when precip rates pick up."

Mountain mayhem 
Slides injure one, claim 2nd victim in 2 days 
By Brady Snyder and Jennifer Dobner
Deseret Morning News 
The lasting image Trace Workman has of his friend Ben Dejong is one of Dejong moving as fast as he could down a mountainside with a massive avalanche barreling down on him.

            Brian Gnehn, Via Davis    County Sheriff
            
        
    

But 20 tons of snow move much faster than human legs can, and the 27-year-old from Bountiful was overtaken.
""I saw Ben, and he was running as fast as he can,"" Workman said. ""It was like an ocean wave when it comes in, and it just engulfed him. There was this big powder cloud, and as soon as that settled I couldn't see nothing. I couldn't see one sign of him.""
For the next 20 to 25 minutes Saturday morning Workman led a frantic rescue effort that included mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and ended with Dejong's life being saved.
Dejong was lucky, and his rescue served as a joyous highlight in an otherwise dangerous and deadly few days.
Snowslides in Utah's backcountry engulfed at least four people and killed two in the past two days in Salt Lake, Wasatch and Davis counties. Two snowshoers are missing. 

    Dejong was caught while snowmobiling with Workman high in Farmington Canyon      above Davis County. 
    The victim of an avalanche Friday above Brighton and Solitude in Big Cottonwood      Canyon was identified Saturday as      Zachary Eastman, 23, Salt Lake        City. A friend escaped. 
    A snowmobiler was killed by an      avalanche Saturday near Strawberry Reservoir. His identity has not yet      been released. 
    And two snowshoers were missing late      Saturday in the Mineral Fork area of Big      Cottonwood Canyon,      where a Salt       Lake County      search and rescue effort there may have been hampered by slides.

State helicopter pilots assisting with the Mineral Fork search from the air reported ""one major and one minor avalanche in the area,"" Salt Lake County Lt. Mike Wardle said.
The men, one aged 60 and one 32, were reported missing about 5:45 p.m. when they failed to return at the expected time, he said.
Because Mineral Fork is a high-risk area for avalanches — and because the avalanche danger has been so high in recent days — the search for the men was expected to be halted around midnight and resumed at first light, Wardle said.

Extreme danger
""All of these slides that have been breaking out have been 3 to 8 feet deep and very difficult to survive,"" said Bruce Tremper, director of the Utah  Avalanche Center.
Avalanche forecasts over the past few days warned would-be backcountry recreationalists of the extreme danger and high potential for slides, especially on or below steep slopes.
""We've had all the important ingredients for an avalanche. We've had a quadruple whammy,"" Tremper said. ""A weak layer of snow is one; a whole bunch of new snow, number two; wind, number three; and rapid temperature rises.""
The avalanche-risk assessment, however, was dropped from ""high"" to ""considerable"" as snow conditions began to stabilize Saturday, Tremper said.
Strawberry tragedy
Despite those improving conditions, a 42-year-old man was killed near Trout Creek in Wasatch County's Strawberry Valley Saturday. The man, whose name was not released, was snowmobiling with a friend when his vehicle became stuck on a steep slope, Wasatch County Sheriff's deputy Corey Davis said.
The avalanche was reported about 11:30 a.m., Davis said, and measured about 500 feet long and 300 feet wide. It broke above the man and buried him in roughly 4 feet of snow. His companion was not caught in the slide, and with the help of another recreationalist, who was carrying an avalanche beacon, the pair was able to locate the man — who was wearing a beacon — and dig him out, Davis said.
The two called 911 from a cell phone. Investigators were still trying to determine how long the man was buried. A medical helicopter transported the man to a Utah County hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Davis said.
Twin  Lakes Pass
Friday afternoon, Eastman was killed near Twin Lakes Pass near the Brighton and Solitude ski areas in Big Cottonwood  Canyon. These are the second and third avalanche deaths in Utah in 2004. A snowshoer died in a Deer Valley slide in February.
""He was a free spirit, and (skiing) is what he lived for, that was his love,"" Eastman's father, Scott Eastman, said Saturday. ""That's the only thing that's giving me a little peace in this.""
Zachary Eastman and a friend had skied the area all day Friday, and both were trained in avalanche safety, his father said. As early as last week, the pair had been to a refresher course on using avalanche beacons, he said.
But sometimes with Mother Nature ""you just don't know which way it's going to go,"" Scott Eastman said.
Farmington Canyon
Dejong might have suffered a similar fate in Davis County.
Workman of Clinton and Dejong regularly frequent the backcountry of Farmington Canyon, snowmobiling below Bountiful Peak. Workman figures they visited the canyon 20 times last year, and with a few feet of fresh snow, Saturday seemed the ideal time to hit the powder again.
""They just love riding up in Farmington Canyon,"" Trace's father, Mark, explained. ""They're these extreme riders.""
It was Trace who apparently triggered the slide, which Davis County Sheriff's Capt. Kenny Payne described as ""very large.""
It was about 9 a.m. when Dejong was using a video camera to film some of his friend's moves in a lofty chute.
Then the mountain caved in.
""I climbed out of the chute and that whole mountainside came down,"" Workman said. ""I looked down, and it was like the whole mountain went out from beneath me.""
Down the hill Dejong desperately tried to start his snowmobile, but the engine wouldn't crank. With a dead motor, the Bountiful man turned and ran, only to be swept up in the powder.
Workman sped down the hill and began desperately searching for his friend. Fortunately, Dejong was wearing an avalanche beacon that allowed Workman to locate the area where his buddy was buried.
Workman dug with his hands for a couple of minutes before being joined by Corey Malan of Ogden.
""We just started digging frantically,"" Malan said.
The rescue
The pair located Dejong's boot about 5 feet below the surface when Malan's two friends caught up with a shovel.
In a painstakingly slow five to eight minutes the foursome uncovered more leg, a knee, a thigh, a torso and finally Dejong's head, which was buried face down.
""At that point it was pretty dark,"" Workman said. ""He was purple and blue and was pretty discolored. At one time I thought he was dead. I thought it was too late.""
The rescuers said there was just a faint hint of breath coming from Dejong's mouth, and Workman offered some mouth to mouth that seemed to help.
The group had already used a cell phone to call for a medical helicopter, and as they waited Dejong lay unconscious for 10 to 12 minutes.
When the helicopter appeared over the mountain, Dejong suddenly sprang to life.
""The first thing out of his mouth was, 'I just can't believe you guys found me,' "" Malan said.
Payne said Dejong was airlifted to University  Hospital as a precaution. He had no broken bones or obvious injuries, Payne said.
It was a rescue effort that turned out much better than one Malan participated in back in 1996 when another friend, Rick Adams, was killed by a massive slide in Farmington Canyon. Searchers didn't find Adams' body for over a month.
'A life saver'
The difference was Adams' lack of an avalanche beacon, which issues a transmission that allows rescuers to pinpoint where a person in buried in the powder.
In Dejong's case, his beacon saved his life, police and rescuers said.
""It's a life saver,"" Malan said. ""I won't go up without one.""
Of course, a beacon does not give people a license to cheat death.
Eastman, the Salt Lake man killed Friday, was also wearing a beacon, but rescuers couldn't revive him despite using CPR.
Avalanche forecasters stressed that much of the new snow that blanketed the Wasatch Front mountains last week had not meshed with old snow, creating a great slide danger. Compounding the problem were sunshine and high temperatures, making the snow even less stable.
""That snow had not bonded underneath. Boy, there are avalanches all along those hills,"" Malan said. ""There were at least six or seven in the next four bowls over. It's really bad up there right now. I told everyone I've seen going up there not to go.""
Tremper said avalanche forecasters did allow an avalanche warning to expire Saturday morning, but he said conditions, with high temperatures and new snow, remain perilous.

                                                       Images by Toby Weed from 4/1/2005

 

  

                            

Tragically, a 27 year-old snowmobiler from Farr West died after triggering this avalanche on the last day of March.  He is the 8th person to die in an avalanche in the Utah backcountry this season.

 

 

                          

The deadly avalanche occurred on a steep wind-drifted slope just south of the slope known as ""Whiskey Hill.""  ""Whiskey Hill"" is on Eccles Peak off the snow-covered Curtis Creek Road, and because hwy 39 is closed in the winter, it is accessible for snowmobilers from either Monte Cristo trail-head (west side near Huntsville and east side near Woodruff). 

 

 

                           

       The slope that avalanched is just a little steeper than Whiskey Hill, (the tracked slope on the right or to the north).  It faces just a little more north, it's shallower and it may have picked up a bit more wind-deposited snow. 

 

            

 

                          

The hard slab avalanche was over 500 feet wide and averaged 4 feet deep at the crown.  The short slope is very steep ( 38 to 45 degrees in slope steepness).

Utah Avalanche Center forecaster, Craig Gordon, has to kick his boot toes into the solid bed-surface in route to the crown.

      

             

 

                        

            The northeast facing slope at just under 9000' in elevation is a classic avalanche trap.    Prevailing winds drift tons of snow from a large open flat area to the west of the slope and deposit it here as they decelerate.   It is a perfect lee-slope fetch area.

 

 

 

                       

 To make matters worse, snow sliding off this slope runs smack into, and then strains through a wall of mature conifers.  The unlucky snowmobiler probably died from massive trauma inflicted by the trees as he was pushed through them by the avalanche.

 

 

                      

      Craig Gordon examines the mechanical properties of the avalanche by digging above the crown.  Up there he can test snow that is undisturbed by the avalanche.  It's important for us to look at avalanches.  We compare what we find in the crown profile of the avalanche path to the snow profiles of slopes in the region that haven't avalanched.  Is there a similar combination of a stiff slab and a thin sugary weak layer?  If so, we must suspect that other human triggered avalanches are possible.

 

 

                       

The stiff wind-deposited slab failed on a thin sugary or faceted layer capped by a dirty wind-crust in early March.  The rest of the solid slab consists of snow deposited in the last 2 big March storms (3/20-2/23 and 3/28-3/30).

 

              

                       

  The cornice above shows us that wind deposited snow builds up on the slope below.  Prevailing winds scour snow off an expansive flat open ridge-top and can rapidly deposit tons of snow onto this steep northeast facing slope.

 

                      

              A single track descending into the middle of the avalanche tells the story.  A snowmobiler rode past his party and down the steep slope.  The avalanche released when he was about 20' into it, right at a steep rocky roll-over where the remaining snow is shallow and weak.  The track enters the slide path in the center, and the slab pulled out a couple hundred feet on either side.

 

                      

             He might have been able to ride out the avalanche if it were on an open slope, but instead he was driven into an unforgiving grove.   These trees are directly in the fall-line below the tracks leading into the avalanche.

 

 

                     

     Tons of snow strained through the trees and piled up deeply around them.  This is looking up at the crown from near the burial site.

 

 

 

                      

             Here is the burial site in a large pile of snow on the downhill side of these trees.  Given the situation, the rider was found quickly by his party who were all equipped with beacons, probes and shovels.  Even so, he died, most likely as a result of trauma.  Statistics show that at least a quarter (or 25%) of avalanche fatalities can be blamed on trauma.  Many die before the avalanche even stops.

The snowboarders did own avalanche rescue gear and practiced with it.  They did not carry it that day because they had no intention of leaving the ski resort.  They didn’t call the avalanche forecast that morning but did read the brief forecast that the ski patrol posts from the Utah Avalanche Center at the backcountry gates.  They were expert snowboarders but their avalanche skills were not as high.  They did note some recent avalanche activity while walking the ridge but were unaware of how sensitive the newer cornices were.  The cornice that broke already had foot tracks from other backcountry travelers that were walking around on it earlier in the day.  This may have given the victim a false sense of security.

The group of six fit a certain profile: highly athletic, young, aggressive riders with boarding skills that far outweigh their avalanche skills.  Only one had taken any sort of avalanche class, and none were wearing or carrying any rescue gear.  Interviews with most of them led me to conclude that none of them had called the avalanche hotline or looked at the Utah Avalanche  Center’s website that day.  One had a brother who had suffered massive injuries and been life-flighted from the Snowbasin backcountry from an avalanche incident a couple years before.  

Epilogue:  
I went in to do the investigation with the help of some Brighton ski patrollers, who promptly had the access gate into the area closed to skier traffic until we were out ‘down and clear’.  Not more than a couple hours after we were gone, two other large avalanches were triggered in the area that completely engulfed the terrain in which we’d been.

They then rapidly organized and performed an effective self rescue, getting their partner out alive.  With this near miss having a good outcome, it could be considered a good learning experience."

It’s always easy to see what went wrong in hindsight, and this accident is no exception.  Most of the group had skied this terrain before, falling into the Familiarity trap.  Before descending the ridge, the group had committed to the idea of not turning back aka, the Commitment heuristic.  It’s likely that there was some Social Facilitation at play as two members of the group had more backcountry experience than the other three.  One member of the group states that he did not feel good about the decision making going on, but, fell victim to the Expert Halo heuristic and didn’t voice his concerns.  I invite anyone interested in these Heuristic Traps to check out Ian McCammon’s work in the area.  All the snow science training in the world will not keep you out of avalanches when these powerful heuristic forces are at work.  This was an expensive lesson for the 4 men and one woman involved, especially the victim who remains in the hospital with numerous serious injuries.

Despite this, obviously mistakes were made.  Tom Diegel was breaking trail and was the default decision maker at the time.  As he noted on the video I took of their party a couple days later when we visited the site, he looked up the slope and noticed that it became slightly steeper above, but it just did not register as being overly dangerous.  The slope where he crossed was only 28-29 degrees, so he was lulled into the belief that it would be safe enough to cross.  He was concerned enough to tell the others that they should cross it one at a time.  In retrospect, he noted that he should have gone back downhill and crossed through the trees much lower on the slope.  The other skiers did not object to his choice of the route, or if they did, no one spoke up.  One person had skied there a couple days earlier and was more familiar with the terrain.  As Tom noted later, he was cold and wanted to warm up, plus he enjoys breaking trail as exercise, so he was in front.  Also, the two people in the rear were still in the thick trees, so they may not have even seen the slope before Tom broke a trail across it.
In our avalanche classes, we usually teach the students to use the ALPTRUTh and FACETS checklist, invented and popularized by Ian McCammon, as a way to assess avalanche danger and the human factors that may affect decisions.  So I will go through those checklists here as well as an after-the-fact exercise.

 In the ALPTRUTh system, you should avoid a slope if you get more than 3 checks and they had 5.5 checks here.  I gave the avalanche path a half-check because it was neither very steep nor large, so an inexperienced person may not have recognized it as avalanche terrain, but it should have been an obvious path to someone with lots of avalanche experience.   The increasing steepness above them did not quite register.  If this was more obvious avalanche terrain, they probably would not have crossed the slope.  Everyone in the party recognized the avalanche hazard that day.  That is why they decided to ski in conservative terrain.  They just did not recognize the problem with that particular terrain feature, or if anyone had concerns, they did not speak up.
Second, research clearly shows that human factors cause many, if not most, avalanche accidents, so I will use Ian McCammonÕs FACETS checklist.  These are ÒheuristicsÓ or mental shortcuts that tend to make people take more risks in the presence of these clues.

            Expert halo – people tend to take more risks when they   are following an ÒexpertÓ.    Sometimes the expert is just the person who knows the route or they   may have the strongest personality.   In this case, they may have seen Tom as an expert   because he had more backcountry experience than the rest of them, plus, he   has a strong, confident personality and the others are softer spoken.

            Tracks – or scarcity--when there are other parties   in the area competing for the limited resource of powder, we tend to take   more risks.  No other parties   were in the area that day and there was plenty of powder, so this was not a   factor.
            
            
             
            
        
        
            
            Social Proof – which I call the Òherding   instinctÓ—when we look to others for proof that what we are doing is   correct.  Most of us simply   follow the crowd instead of go against the flow.  This was probably present in this accident as they were all   following the trailbreaker and no one questioned his route, or if they did,   no one spoke up.  In their   defense, the last two people, who were also the ones caught, were in thick   trees, so they may not have even seen the complete slope until Matt stepped   out onto it and the avalanche occurred.    Our brains are hard wired for safety-in-numbers and this often gives   us a false sense of security.    This is called Òrisky shiftÓ in the business community, when larger   committees tend to take more risks.    Would anyone in that party have crossed that slope if he were skiing   alone?  Probably not.

Other human factors include what is known as Òloss aversionÓ.  In other words, once you gain something, you will do almost anything to avoid loosing it.  In this case, after they gained some elevation, they did not want to drop back down to a safer crossing because they would have lost some of their hard-gained elevation.  Tom is very fit and he enjoys breaking trail, so it was probably not much of a factor, but it is a powerful heuristic that affects us all.  Going back the way they came—even for a short distance—is a choice that few people ever consider.
The weather may have contributed to the accident as well, because it was cold.   Tom started out breaking the trail because he wanted to warm up.  Other party members were more familiar with the more standard route up the nearby sub-ridge, which avoids the particular terrain feature that avalanched.
Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court was designed many years ago, so that one justice always wrote a dissenting opinion on important, close decisions.  Early courts recognized the risks with social proof and acceptance heuristics.  They found that if someone always took the ÒdevilÕs advocateÓ position, it forced the majority to reexamine their beliefs and address the problems in their logic illuminated by the contrary position.  Similarly, in backcountry decisions, I feel that it is important not only for members to speak up when they see a problem, but for a leader to always ferret out other opinions from others in the group.
We have found these checklists useful, not only for judging danger before an accident, but as a post-accident debriefing.  My report probably misjudged some of these factors, especially the human factors, which are subjective and uncertain.  Regardless, we see a lot of checks in the boxes above.
We write these comments not to lay blame or judge, because we all make these same mistakes, but we use it as a way for others to learn.  Telling stories is our most ancient learning method and it works well for avalanche accidents.

 I began dropping cornices in the 99 Steps Chute area. I dropped at least 7 chunks descending the ridgeline to the North. Cornices were sensitive and very hard/firm. They were in the size of a small car for the most part. After the 7th chunk I released a small mini-van size chunk about 250 to 300 feet down the ridgeline from the 99 Steps Chute; and it struck the slope and triggered the slide. It propagated back up to the 99 Steps Chute and also propagated down the ridge at lease another 400 feet. The largest crown face area appeared to be at least 6 feet and most likely closer to 7 feet. It was difficult to get a good close look at the triggering point. Graupel pooling and extreme wind loading appeared to play a large part in the slab development. The slide occurred 130 feet down off the ridge where a cliff/rock face rolls over for steepness. The slide went to the ground at the top of all the starting zones. The aspect at the trigger point was ENE. Upon descending the ridgeline to the North, when the bowl loses steepness before the pass, I entered the East side of the bowl and experienced collapsing and propagating on 23 degree slopes. The aspect in this area is ESE.

 

Weather during the day was a combination of intermittent snow, gusty winds and partially clearing skies. New snow during the day was 2 to 3 inches. Winds were out of the SSW. Transport was heavy at times of the stronger winds. Loading was occurring well down the slopes. Propagation previously mentioned on the 23 degree slopes also was shearing in facets directly above the ground and on these ESE aspects there was not a m/f crust 5 inches above the ground. Cracking occurred with minimal slope movement. The stress crack was 3 mm wide. No other signs of instability were observed. This kind of deep slab instability appears to be isolated to upper elevation wind loaded areas on NW, N, NE, E, and SE aspects. The pattern appears to indicate that slides are breaking well down off the ridgelines and below the normal steep starting zones.

I was quite surprised by how far it ran, and I think if someone had been below me but out of sight this slide could have been a big problem for them.  I knew know one was there as I had put in the skin track to the peak.  I knew this chute was going to move but I was quite surprised how fast and how far it went.  I generally try not to be surprised in the backcountry, and I am mad when I get surprised.  I think this chute was far more windloaded and denser than I would have guessed from my previous runs in main and banana days on similar aspects.  I did have a very small soft slab release at the bottom of main days on a very steep (>45 degrees) aspect, but it was totally manageable and expected.  I think this slide surprised me because of how predictable things had been over in days fork.  I forgot my camera so there are no pics.  (first trip of the season, I was lucky I remembered the beacon).  It did pull out parts of the chute that were not directly in the slide path in a sort of sympathetic fashion.

While ascending the ridge of Rocky Points from Katherine's Pass I triggered three avalanches in the first three chutes. These were triggered by very small cornice drops, walking slope cuts, and gentle stomping on the ridgeline. The snow was very sensitive. Propagation was quick and widespread in this area. The snow that was active was all areas that received loading from the NW winds but had not gotten thick with wind loading. The slabs were all soft slabs and the deepest crown face was 11 inches with the majority of crown faces around 8 inches. In the Second Chute after the slide filtered through a narrow choke it fanned out to 60 feet wide with propagation. All slides were in the new snow only. Widespread cracking was occurring in all starting zones with slopes < 35 degrees not moving more than 5 mm stress cracks. All slides were initiating on slope angles 37 degrees and greater. Slides were not making it to the flats with the deepest debris piles 2 to 3 feet deep. Obviously they most likely wouldn't bury you, but they could ruin your day and push you into a place where you didn't want to go. These slides occurred at 10:00 am. Weak layer was the old snow interface, and there appeared to be light density layer directly above the old snow surface. The aspects ranged from ENE to SE.
On the exit at 3:00 pm I was able to trigger the steep chute on rider's right of the main chute in the Dog Lake Chutes area. This slide was a pocket that was a foot deep and ran to the flat transition. Soft slab again. It started out 20 feet wide and propagated to 60 feet wide as it rolled over the steep section 70 feet down hill. The aspect was NNE. After triggering this Chute I traversed to the Main Chute. In the main Chute I triggered a sluff that was 20 feet wide and taking almost all the new snow. This also ran to the transition. All weak layers were the same as in the Rocky Points area. The slope angles were at least 37 degrees.
After riding on the Dog Leg Chute in the Rocky Points area I went to Point Supreme and skied the North aspect and as well as the South aspect. At this point in time the Supreme area has not opened for the season yet.  In steep areas with wind loading (and firm/hard slab loading) I was not experiencing anything more than limited cracking without any movement. The best riding was on the lower half of the Helicopter Shot on Point Supreme. All of the slopes besides the Dog Leg Chute in the Katherine's area were wind damaged with either cross wind destruction or up slope wind waves. Sunset was destroyed. 
New snow in Brighton was 8 inches. New snow in the Katherines area and on Point Supreme was closer to 10 inches. 
The hazard appeared to be Moderate in areas of wind loading. The hazard on Tuesday may be Considerable with increasing temperatures and solar triggering. "

As we gawked at the crown, our 4th and final party member kicked off a smaller pocket from above which was much smaller, but still caused us to ski quickly out of the way, across the bed surface of the original slide. This pocket behaved a little oddly, in that it broke far above us, and a few seconds after the skier had come to a stop.

The sun had been hitting the slope for much of the morning, (although the snow was still creamy and soft on the surface) and I think heated thing up just enough to make the buried crust a slip and slide. The slide broke below and away from the original tracks. Perhaps that skier will also chime in with details.  We exited the rest of the way into the lower slopes of Primrose Cirque via the ridgetop above the avalanche path. We got a pretty good look at it.

This slope was more wind protected and had a more defined layer of surface hoar which was buried by deeper snow.  This combined with a steeper slope angle was the difference between the first slope we skied and the second which failed.

The weak layer was a density change in Tuesdays snow; stellars on the bed surface mixed graupel above, 4 finger wind blown. The MLK crust was burried a meter down in this location. I got a STE, (CT2Q1, ECTN) x2 on the week layer. I got a CTN for the facets around the MLK crust, which is about 3 inches thick with 1-2mm facets below. As the avalanche descended it intrained all the new snow, I think, on the MLK crust which isn't as burried as deep further down the slope.

In looking at the picture below, you can see where he skied from right to left in intentionally release the slab and duck in there beneath he cliffband.  Of course this type of thing is commonplace for a ski patroller of 15 years - or other snow professionals under these circumstances.  We knew the avalanche we were dealing with - and it was not a hard slab, deep slab or dealing with a persistent grain type.   
 
 
Of great interest, however, was the loud whoomph at the bottom of the slope.  After the avalanche had run its course 700'  to the flats, the fourth skier down to the debris triggered a very loud, widely propagating Deep Slab collapse.  Probing had the rain crust buried there 6-9' deep.

As the day wore on and the temps and sun rose, the snow started to get more damp and stick to my skins so we figured it was time to leave.  We headed back to the car by taking a relatively direct route from the top of Reynolds down the South face back to the Mill D parking lot.  The conditions on that aspect were about 5 inches of new snow on top of a solid and slick sun crust.    As my wife descended first she initiated a small point release behind her which looked like minor sloughing of the new snow on top of the sun crust.  It moved pretty slowly (never more than 10-15 mph max) but started to get wider and pick up more and more snow.  It eventually caught up to her when she stopped and carried her for about 50 feet until she grabbed a small tree and it continued (still slowly) another couple hundred feet.  The whole thing probably lasted more than a minute and carved all the new snow off the slope down to the sun crust.  It never moved quickly or violently and didn't seem like it would have buried anybody but it would not have been pleasant had it pulled anyone over a cliff or other hazard.  In retrospect we underestimated how fast the sun and rapidly warming temperatures were changing the snow conditions.  We also could have chosen any number of less direct return routes to the car that would not have been nearly as susceptible to this type of activity which was clearly predicted in the morning avalanche advisory.  It is interesting to note that the underlying crust was so slick it seemed that the wet snow continued sliding on slope angles that were substantially less than 30 degrees."

I had some reluctance about skiing in this area, and about this slope, but skied it anyway. I was feeling a bit of (unstated, and possibly imagined) group pressure. A cornice was easily available to drop on the slope, but I did not avail of this test, nor did I make a slope cut. It was all my own doing. Clues to instability were all around me: a foot of new snow, wind loading, spontaneous sluffing, and new snow sliding on crust.  The new snow sluffed just below the ridgeline, leaving a (estimated size) 12-14 inch crown. The sluff knocked me down, carried me a short distance, and I was not buried. The underlying firm layer allowed me to dig my skis and poles in, and I hung on, while the sluff passed me. The pressure I felt from  this small slide was impressive; much more and I would not have been able to hold on.  No injuries, other than to my pride and faith in my judgement.

There were 3 tracks into West Bowl, 2 of which were from the summit and one from lower down on the shoulder to the east. We hadn't seen any instabilities and knew the winds had been blowing per the avie report and what we saw as the sun came up while on top of Silver Fork/Honeycomb Ridge.   While skinning up into West Bowl I was breaking trail and pulled over to let another lead out, noticing that there was a graupel layer about 4-5"" down. When rejoining the skin track there were small pieces of slab that slid on this graupel layer onto the skin track below me which I should have kept in mind later in our tour. Mistake #1.   As we neared the top of West Bowl, one of our party suggested holding up as the other two went to the top and he would take some photos as we descended into west bowl with Alta in the background. As we skinned up to the top I thought it best to descent skiers left of the existing tracks, but then focusing more on the photos decided to ski to the skiers right of the summit along the ridgeline and then drop in allowing for a better photo. Mistake #2.  I pushed off and made a couple of turns along the ridge gaining some speed and made my third turn to the right along the ridge/cornice edge which was more rounded in this spot. Exiting this turn and making the next turn to my left into the main part of the bowl I looked out ahead and saw what in a split second looked like a skin track but then clearly looked like a large ripple. I then realized the snow around me was rippling up and looking over my shoulder saw I was in the middle of a slide that had broken at the top of ridge where my third turn was. Fortunately I was carrying enough speed to maintain a trajectory across the slide and exit to the skiers left as the slab and other snow was carried another 200' down slope clipping the edge of the pines in West Bowl.  Luckily for me the slide was only 60' wide and at most 12"" deep which likely wouldn't have completely buried me given it didn't entrain more snow but I easily could have been knocked down and strained through the pines.

I made two mistakes and after thinking about I can look back and learn.  I remember when  skinning up last Friday and I was looking at the big snow crystals on the top of the snow (surface hoar) and made the comment that this could be a weak layer come next storm.  Had powder fever and totally forgot all about that observation when I headed up.  I also made the classic mistake of seeing many tracks and assuming that sincemany people had skied it that its not going to slide.  So me and my partner rode the first pitch, one at a time, with no problems.  Same line we all took off the cornice and down to the flat section last Friday.  Last time I rode that line I went skiers right of that flat section and into the main chute, however me and my partner decided to stay in the trees since that was where the best snow was.  I started the second pitch and about my third turn snow was fracturing all around me.  The fracture shot out about 15 ft to my left and about 50 feet to my right.  I carved a hard left and was eventually able to get out to the side of it.  I shouted out ""AVALANCHE"" for my partner and put the avalung in my mouth as I made the desperate carve to the left.  Another thing that kinda freaked me out was the slide started in the glade within the trees and spread out to some thick tree sections of the bowl. Slab was about 75-100 feet wide and about 14 inches thick and ran for a hundred yards.  I always kinda assume that trees were a safer choice, not last night.  My theory is that the sun was out all day and got kinda warm.  Even though those trees did not see any direct sun it got warm enough to consolidate that new snow layer into a thick slab.  The cold nights really built up some surface hoar in those sheltered tree zones making a weak layer that was not found in the main chute.  The main avalanche chute had enough daytime sun to keep those weak crystals building up actually making the gut a safer choice.  Lesson learned."

My friend was roughly 6 or 7 feet above me and noted some slabbiness in the snow. I was close to the trees and nearly on the ridge, but not near enough, apparently, as my friend took a couple of steps and triggered a wind slab. The slab broke right at his feet, so he stayed right next to the crown, but I was pushed off my feet and down the slope. I tried self arresting but couldn't get a hold in the snow and wasn't able to grasp any branches well enough to stop my momentum, and I was taken about 100 feet down the slope until the slab broke up and slid away from me. Upon inspection, we could see the wind slab had broke roughly 2 feet deep, went about 30 feet downhill, and then had triggered another wind slab that was around a foot deep, and continued down the slope. Aside from the two distinct crowns, the rest of the slide was only about 6 inches deep. We could see from the top that it had gone a long ways, but after skiing down, it was apparent that it went nearly the entire length of the slope, roughly 1500' vertical. The weakness appeared isolated to the top of Kessler, which makes complete sense considering the ferocious winds the day before, as we didn't notice any similar issues on our ski down in the more protected terrain.

The fracture line went all along the southern boarder of the face starting at around 10400', up to about 11200', across the bowl and to the northern edge (we could not see the northern edge of the crown therefore total width estimate is difficult, perhaps about 1/4 - 1/3 mile?). Depth appeared to vary but the crown looked to be about 1 foot for most of it. The debris appeared to have stopped mostly at the bench around 9700', but it looked like some debris ran into the gully far below. We decided to cut a cornice to see what affect it would have on the slope. With people C and D spotting, A and B approached the chosen cornice. Right where/when spotter C said to 'stop' the cornice released between A and B's feet. Luckily both stepped back onto the ridge. The cornice was about 20 feet wide, perhaps 10 feet out. It triggered another 200+ foot wide avalanche on the east face of Mt Nebo (it was very hard to see just how far the new crown propagated due to our extreme hesitation to get too close to the edge).

At this time our party decided to retreat.  Another Note/Observation A natural cornice fall had occurred sometime the night before in the NW couloir. This cornice fall then triggered a slide which propagated all the way down the chute to the apron. From afar we were not sure what exactly had happened but as we gained elevation we could see the point where the cornice had fallen from above a large cliff and landed in the couloir. As we got even closer we could see sympathetic crowns/fractures all the way down the chute on the looker's right side and we began to really understand and appreciate how huge the resulting debris pile in the apron was."

That slide was 9800', NE facing. I didn't go back and it inspect it  as it was so minor. I'd estimate angle to be 35-36 degrees. There were  shooting cracks as I eased onto the slope, I knew it was going to  release in some manor. It was right above some trees which prevented it  from running too far but I believe the slope was a little bit convex  which also helped stop it. It didn't pack any sort of punch, I'd call it  a soft slab (but I'm no expert). The bed surface seemed to be a couple  of inches of the firm October snow.

This terrain MUST be treated as if it were the backcountry, proper backcountry protocol must be adhered to (riding one at a time, not skiing on top of others, etc), and personal responsibility is critical (ie - be prepared with avalanche rescue gear, 1st aid equipment, and a repair kit.)

Another word on the incidents (Gunsight at Alta and this Gad Valley one).  The rescue teams from the ski areas and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue often put their necks out on the line to access and evacuate an injured party.  It was reported that other parties at Alta continued to ski and knock down avalanches into Greeley Bowl while the rescue was in progress.  Creating another incident during this situation is unacceptable.

Dropping in, nothing happened as I made my first turn, but as I made a second turn, to my right towards the safe zone, the slide was triggered.  My guess is that the wind-loaded top layer broke and stepped down to the subsequent two layers below.  The resulting multilayer hard slab propagated above, to the flatter ridgetop, as well as 30 feet skier's left and 10 feet skier's right.  Vertically, the slab released was likely around 80'.  Right and left boundaries of the slide path seemed dictated by terrain features:  significant rock outcroppings.  Debris traveled downhill at least 250 vertical feet, stopping as terrain flattened.  Following the slide, further analysis suggested significant energy between the bed surface and failing layer.  The slope was measured around 37 degrees.

The initial fracture was approximately 100 yds wide, but quickly propagated on both sides reaching a width of 1/4 mile.  The slide appears to have slid on facets on top of a stout wind slab that was 5"" thick in most areas with more large-grained facets underneath. In places the slide stepped down taking the old wind slab with it.  The depth of the slab ranged from 8"" to 40"" and very quickly gained speed before stopping in the flats 900' below.  Slopes steep enough to slide are VERY touchy right now.  All it took was a 50lb chunk of snow tumbling a couple times to trigger a large violent avalanche with very high likely un-survivable consequences if caught.

I was in the Hidden Canyon avalanche of 1-22-12  I would like you all  to  know that the group was 3 snowboarders and one skier.  Only 2 of us  were caught in the slide.   No one was partially buried and no one  required assistance to become  unburied.  The two caught in the slide  self rescued via death grip on a  tree.  All four people in the group  have had avalanche training.  We  also knew that this avalanche cycle is  one of the worst ever.  It is  true we didnt have our avy gear with us.   So yes we did f*@# up in that  aspect, but beacons and shovels wouldnt  have saved me or my buddy if  we had gone much further down the slide  path because those trees and  cliffs would have smashed the life out of  us,
The group did not intend to ski into Hidden Canyon, we were traversing   when the avy hit.  Our plan was to traverse above the chutes and ski the   ridge line between Lack-o-waxen and Hidden Canyon with the ultimate   goal of skiing some low angle trees off of 10420.
Looking back at what we did wrong, and I know from everyone out there that this is a long list so I won't hit on the obvious.
First , we should have hiked straight up Claytons Peak from the chair   lift and then we would have been on the ridge line without having to   traverse above Brown Spot (The Hidden Canyon Headwall).
Second, as crazy as this sounds If i had been on skis, I believe this   slide would not have happened.  Because, as we traversed above the   chutes the skier in our group was able to maintain a high traverse and   was safely above the crown.  The slide was triggered when 2 of us   (snowboarders) stopped together at a spot way too low off the ridge.
Thirdly,  our spacing on the traverse was really bad. when the 2 of us   stopped next to each other the weight of both of us together triggered   the slide.
Original report:
Brighton Patrol received report of a avalanche in the Hidden Canyon sidecountry area around 11AM. They reported a group of four was on the slope when it slide. All 4 were caught and carried. 2 partially buried, but uninjured.
They knew the hazard was HIGH, but stated they were more aware now. They carried no rescue gear although at least one had rescue gear in the car.

He rode off of the last slab and slammed into the wall left behind (crown face) bending his handlebars to the windshield.  His buddy below was able to turn out and outrun the slide, which was amazing because of the thick trees at the base of Whiskey.  They were both very lucky.

I can't believe the two attempted to climb Whiskey that day with the avalanche danger rate High on your site.  More questionable was the fact that both were climbing together.

It went on to say, ""t’s gonna be one of those days - Bluebird, light wind, 5 star powder (for this year anyway). Truth be told, it’s also days like these where we see avalanche accidents. Discipline, self-denial – these are things we not only aspire to – it’s what keeps us alive in conditions like these. Even – perhaps especially – if you see other tracks on the slope. Or that others are getting away with it. It has applications in other parts of our lives as well.""

""Skier A and skier B skinned up flagstaff to access Days fork. There were two ski tracks dropping into Days fork via the ENE aspect in a slighty treed area and a skin track in the same area coming back up out of Days fork. Skier A dropped first staying in the same area as the two tracks and the skin track. Skier B dropped the same area. Both skiers then skinned back up the existing skin track. About 30 feet from the ridgeline skier B decided to dig a pit so skier A made his way up towards the ridge to a safe spot. Skier B then traversed out from the skin track and onto slightly steeper slope to dig a pit. Skier B had enough time to take his skis off and get his shovel and saw out before a 2.5' slab broke about 20 feet above him and propagated 150' to the south. Skier B struggled to run up the slab and get out but was not able to escape. Skier B took a ride to the bottom of the slope. Luckily ending up on top and uninjured. Skier A then dropped to skier B to assist in locating gear, able to find everything except shovel, saw and skis.""

The avalanche took out the climbing track and all the ski tracks.

Jake stumbled onto the avalanche shortly after and saw the tracks at the bottom which came out of the debris and then their original climbing track back in.  He was unable to see where they exited the the crown at the top of the slope and feared it had avalanched on them as they were ascending, burying both of them.  WBR and WPG were quickly put into action and initiated a search.  After putting people on the debris and doing a recco & beacon sweep, no signals were found and it was determined that someone had boot hiked back up the slide path.

If you trigger an avalanche like this, PLEASE contact Alta Central (801-742-2033) so that time and money are not wasted in needless searches as well as putting rescuers in difficult situations for no reason.

Last, this slide path is statistically one of the most active in our region with countless close calls.  It has become common that a climbing track is put in the avalanche path.  This is an unsafe practice for obvious reasons.

We rode many other mellow slopes throughout the day with no signs of instability.  Pit tests looked pretty good all around.  I got an ECTP 26 on a 22 degree west facing slope earlier in the day.  The failure occurred about 2 inches below the faceted/2-week-old snow interface.   Another pit in a similar area didn’t produce any CT failures.  It was interesting to note that the facets near the ground are becoming slightly more rounded and look like they are beginning to bond.

Its always good, and Thanks is always given, when you come back from a day of riding with your sled in one piece and everyone is safe. This day extra Thanks was given. Avalanche conditions are still bad as illustrated by the pictures below. We went to one of our favorite spots to do some climbing. I like climbing here because it has a large run-out and options for the worst case scenario's. I am glad I had extra power (12 lbs boost) and was able to climb out above it. Not a fun filling when the ground starts moving on you. It broke 30' above me and I was able to climb to what I thought was safety above the slide. I got nervous (more nervous) above where it broke, because I thought out of the corner of my eye I saw another fracture and I didn't have the speed to climb out of that one. So, I turned and went down and deployed my airbag. BTW I have always thought it would be hard to pull the handle while riding and having to let go of the handle bars. It took all of .1 seconds to reach and grab and pull and then hammer down. Now I came down with the worry of not knowing what was following behind me. Got to the bottom and I was now moving fast, 60+ mph, and realized there is a big pile of snow at the bottom and I am now going airborne. Squared up the best I could and took some air off a 5' slab kicker! Got some air and landed hard but I was know out of the danger zone. I am very grateful that nobody was hurt. I didn't need to deploy the bag, but its better to be safe than sorry. Interested point. I got to the bottom and thought, ""stupid airbag didn't event deploy."" I really couldn't even tell that it was out and it didn't impede my riding or ability to ride fast and jump some technical spots. Took all of 5 min to pack it back up. Thanks to SNOWBIGDEAL and getting me a refill tank the next day for $35. We inspected the slide after and apparently what I thought was another fracture above me was a set off coyotes tracks traversing horizontally across the top. Having a radio would of been nice for my spotter to tell me stay up and not turn and come down. Lesson learned: A hill that has previously broke, doesn't mean it wont break again."

While we could not do crown profile, we can suppose the failure was  either the rime-capped SH from mid-January, a combination of sun crusts  and facets, or perhaps just full failure to the mid-November dirt layer  over depth hoar. Hopefully we can get a better look at it before the  next storm.

Forecaster Note: UDOT LCC forecaster Chris Covington and I went to look at the slide today and found the that the failure plane was .5mm rounds and a few 1mm rounding facets above a 2"" thick melt freeze crust.  The avalanche collapsed the variable rime/mf crust (2cm above the mf crust).  One could pass this off as a typical crust/facet sandwich, but the facets did not seem weak or loose - they seemed more rounded and chalky, even ""damp"" - though they were not.  Collapse failure must have been the ticket here.  When you combine this southwest facing slope and another (sw-facing) 3' deep avalanche in Dry Fork (backside of Alta), and multiple collapses on due south, you know your snowpack has problems.

They reported it to the Alta Ski Patrol, which we all greatly appreciate. Then, they wisely decided to quite riding for the day.
Brett Kobernik and I took a look at it a day after it was triggered.  There have been a lot of avalanches triggered and collapsing reported on south facing slopes, so we were curious about the culprit weak layer.  In fact, the gentle, bottom part of the avalanche runout below the debris collapsed on us as we approached from the bottom.  The culprit was caught red handed--or rather, white weak-layered in this case.
Despite lots of digging, Brett and I were disappointed that we could not find any clear smoking gun, but the weak layer appeared to be a subtle, hard-to-identify-and-see, weak layer above a sun crust.  Despite lots of microscope work, we're still not sure what the weak layer was but there was a very thin layer of some very small faceted crystals present on top of the sun crust and I thought I saw some surface hoar at times.  Whatever it is, it was disappointedly subtle and left us scratching our heads (the real reason I'm bald).  We also dug where we got the collapse and were heartbroken not to identify any clear culprit.  Whatever it was, it's doing a lot of collapsing and avalanching so it has to be some kind of monkey business (persistent weak layer such as facets or surface hoar).  It's still a mystery, at least to our puny brains--despite about 50 years of professional experience between us.
The bottom line is that the snowpack is extremely complex right now with multiple weak layers and a very complex history.  It's hard to trust very much.
We also saw several other slabs of the same vintage on south facing slopes in the area--most appeared to be wind slabs on steep slopes.  We also dug in one northeast facing avalanche fracture and still did not see any weak layer that was too obvious--just a thin, small-grained faceted layer probably from February.  It preferred to break on this unimpressive layer rather than the large-grained, impressive depth hoar near the ground.  I suspect that the rapid loading from Wednesday night reactivated some subtle layers that would normally be sleeping.
I will add photos and perhaps a video and perhaps a snow profile later...  But it's late and it may have to wait till morning."

A small second slide was triggered sympathetically just north (100') across a rib on a seemingly unconnected starting zone.  Second skier on the slope, remotely triggered, and a sympathetic to boot.  Pretty interesting.
Hand shears showed several different weak layers in the upper snowpack that were not uniform from slope to slope, but ultimately, the collapsing and cracking were uniform on high elevation S and E aspects and the hazard was obvious. "

Collapse failure occurred below this crust and it propagated 350 feet to the riders left.

As  he was coming down the he made a sidehill cut under some trees.  The  terrain is rocky and the snowpack there was shallow.  The slide  propagated the slope and it crowned out about 30 feet above him at the  ridgeline in the trees.  Crown looked to be 2.5-3 feet in height.   Failed on the february crust layer.  Slide was probably 40-50 feet in  width and traveled maybe 200-250 feet.  

I may or may not have footage of the slide, havent checked yet, and  soon as i recognized what was happening the camera was thrown down to  get out essentials for rescue.  He was buried at the toe of the slide.  probably about 1 -2 feet down.  I had my shovel out and ready and beacon  out before the slide even stopped moving.  Where my probe was supposed  to be it was gone, it must have fallen out of its holster earlier in the  day.  Was not a good feeling.  He had an airbag, but kept missing the  handle.  I kept eyes on him and was able to see either his back pack or  helmet sticking out as the slide came to rest.  By the time i had ran  the 60 feet to get to the spot, he was able to lift his head out of the  snow.  Had him fully extracted in about 2 minutes.  No harm or injury to  rider or machine.  Just a good learning experience.

2 things I wanted to comment about.  The first is familiarity with  the terrain.  We ride the area all the time, checked the reports this  morning, and knew what we were up against.  There were signs of other  slides (that went in the storm) and we had heard two large ones come  down earlier.  Had he not cut across into the rockier terrain I believe  the slide would stil be there waiting to get someone.  Its in a high  traffic area, and covered the usual trail in and out. Goal was to stay  out from underneath any terrain traps, and we were in no way going near  the usual avy zones.  Just happened to cut the wrong spot.  Unusual  year, with unusual snow pack.  Best be extra cautious.

The other thing i wanted to mention was training.  When it all  started happening, there was a strong urge to panic.  I took 2 big deep  breaths, and remembered all my training.  I was able to clear my head  and get my gear ready very very quickly.  Luckily I didnt have to probe  or shovel too much (it was just me and him out there).  I cannot  emphasize enough how critical the training is.  Without it, i probably  would have panicked and locked up.  Looking forward to helping out again  this year in educating others.

Ride safe out there and thanks again for all your hard work!

We were on the sub-peak of reynolds directly to the east of the summit. We planned to ride back down along the spine of the ridge between the south and east facing slopes but stopped to dig a pit just for a bit of education of how the main face was most likely set up. We found the full gamut of layers, with significant failures on an isolated block on some depth hoar about 3 feet down, as well as some lighter failures at the top of the more dense snow  from earlier this week (most likely wind slab, which was found about 2 feet down) and just above a melt-freeze crust about 4 feet down. Once we finished up with the pit I began to descend directly down the spine of the ridge, along the border of the trees. About 5 turns down, I dropped about 2 feet off to skiers right (onto the south face) to get around a tree and stopped to wait for my partner. At this point I noticed a very large sympathetic slide running, at about 100-200 feet into the slope from where I had just skied. It looked to be about 200-300 ft wide at the widest point of propagation, with highly variable crown that was anywhere from centimeters to 2.5-3 ft deep to my eye. It ran down through the trees and the full length of the slide path, into the valley below the peak. It looked to be a soft slab, with several large blocks of the crown dispersed around the starting point. I suspect it failed somewhere in the wind slabs that we had noticed before.   Glad I've honed in my skills enough to know that that slope was sure to slide, this certainly confirmed that hunch. Great turns were had on safer, lower aspect skiing all around Reynolds.

The avalanche that I took a picture of might be the slide the party was caught in but, I searched the bed surface looking for tracks and also looked up at the crown and saw no tracks. However, this is all speculation on my part."

I was about ten turns in when I saw a crack appear underneath my skis; by the next turn, I could see the southern flank of the slab pulling out from a steeper, more northerly terrain feature, about 100 feet to my left and 200 feet downslope.  The slide ran into a dense aspen grove, audibly snapping trees up to four inches in diameter.  My group of three used the gentle ridge on the N side of this terrain feature to descend, following our skin-track, and we were able to access the debris, making sure there was no evidence other people had been in the runout.  We did not approach the crown of this slide.   We made a few serious mistakes yesterday.  First, we ignored, or failed to take seriously, obvious signs of instability.  Along the ridge, we felt a couple relatively small, isolated collapses; we told each other they seemed like they were coming from underneath obvious wind drifts, which themselves were covered in roughly 10 inches of light density, settled, deceptively un-wind-affected snow.  Furthermore, we could not see obvious signs of recent avalanches in lower and middle Mineral Fork, although clouds obscured the Room of Doom all morning.  At a location where the slope measured 30 degrees and an altimeter read 8300', we walked onto the slope to dig a pit.  In 140 cm of snow, we found a Q2 shear, ECTP 15, 75cm from the ground, on very small facets underneath a 1F MF crust.  At 60 cm from the ground, we found another Q2, ECTP 23, failing on similarly small facets beneath what I believe was a pencil hard, 2mm thick rain/rime crust from 2/21 or 2/22.  There was no dirt layer or late-december rain crust at this location.  The snowpit was a couple hundred feet to the north of where this avalanche occurred, and probably 200 vertical feet below the highest portion of the crown, but I am confident the slide ran on one of the shears we found in our snowpit.   Our second, more serious error, was in choosing terrain we had only developed an impression of, without really knowing its characteristics.  No one in our party had been on this slope before yesterday, although one member of the group and I have remarked on previous occasions that it looked like a great run.  Upon reaching the slope yesterday, I thought it looked ""low angle,"" and several slope angle measurements along the flank of the slope adjacent to our up-track were in the low 30's.  In yesterday's flat light, it was easy to look all the way across the slope without identifying any terrain features that seemed to be likely spots for an avalanche to release.  We projected our slope angle measurements to the open expanse of the slope to our right.  After being highlighted by a large crown and mangled bed surface, a broad, very shallow gully in the middle of the face, just to the skiers left of my intended descent route became obvious.  I consciously took the appearance of a dense thicket of middle-aged aspens directly at the base of the slope to indicate that this slope rarely, if ever slid.  Indeed, it would seem that full-track avalanches on this slope are rare, yet historically occasional events, as just a few, well flagged spruces--with generations of smaller aspen trunks piled up against them--are resident in this stand of forest."

Once the slide stopped moving he moved from his position, and to my relief came into view. The other members of the party descended and we regrouped glad that everyone was safe.  I called Alta Central to report the slide and no injuries or burials. 
In hindsight there are several things learned today. 
 The first was that proper communication amongst group members is critical.  Knowing each others route choices, stopping points, order of and location of drop-in, etc.  We were not as organized as we should have been and were fortunate that no one was caught.  I am confident that we would have been able to perform and execute a search and rescue, but I also know that we would not have been as efficient as we should have been due to lack of proper communication before the skiing began; and as we all know, speed and efficiency is paramount to a successful rescue.  
Second is the classic example of jumping into dangerous terrain on a day with some of the best skiing conditions of the year and ""moderate"" danger despite the fact that we all knew of the lingering hazards that have plagued our snow-pack this year.  As with everyone out there, we were chomping at the bit to get into steeper terrain and jump off of something.  It goes to show that you can be conservative all year long, but it only takes one error in judgement to cause a situation that could potentially be fatal.  We were very lucky that an incident was avoided.

Just wanted to clarify the events from the burial today as I was on the scene and am getting a lot of questions as to what was going on and the logistics of the parties.

There were 3 parties involved:

Party 1 - Skiing into the Gulch
Skier 1
Skier 2

Photographer
Party 2 - Skinning across the flats, 50m above the houses
Myself (RM)
KL

Party 3 - Skinning up the Michigan City road
AR
JC

Photographer skied down to mid slope for a good angle on the shot.  Skier 1 skied down right past Party 2 to gain momentum before dropping into the slope.  Slope fractures, Skier 1 pulls airbag, is swept into the gulch and fully buried.  Party 3 calls across to Party 2, and AR and RM descend into the gulch, to assist photographer.  JC and KL both call Alta Central, Skier 2 descends to KL wondering what is going on.  Probe strikes airbag at .5m depth.  Full recovery, no injuries.  Left ski was still on, right ski was lost in the pile.


In retrospect, my biggest takeaway is the importance of communication.  In this event, there were 3 people involved in the rescue, from 3 different parties.  None of us had ever met, and we all arrived at different times.  It was imperative that we communicate and work together so that we didn't get in each other's way, or duplicate the steps.  Everything said, I think we all are feeling lucky today that everything went so smooth.


FORECASTER COMMENTS: -Brett Kobernik

I spoke with the female that was caught and buried in the avalanche.  She described the day to me and it is a common scenario that other people have had happen to them before. It’s a scenario that could easily happen to many of us in the future.

 

The group of three (herself, another female and a male photographer) were shooting photos within the Alta Ski Area during the day.  It was one of those days with beautiful snow, great weather and everything was just coming together for them.  The invigorating conditions and bliss of the day is what clouded their judgement, in her opinion.  Again, this is a common theme that can happen to anyone.

 

They were not intending to go into the backcountry on this day, hence why some of the party did not have all of their normal avalanche gear.  However, as the day went on, it was decided that they would make the very short journey to a popular slope for photographing skiers and snowboarders.  They had read the avalanche advisory for that day and understood it.  Human triggered avalanches were likely on such slopes.  The awesome day that was in progress, the familiarity with the slope, as well as the perception of the slope being so small and not dangerous overrode their knowledge of the avalanche conditions.  

 

It was decided that the victim would go first since she was carrying all of her normal avalanche gear.  Once she was on the slope and realized she had triggered the avalanche, she immediately deployed her avalanche airbag and started the ride downhill.  She was on the surface and was purposely swimming for a group of trees which she managed to get to and grab a hold of, stopping herself briefly.  The second portion of the avalanche that released sympathetically overcame her and she was not able to hold on.  She was carried to the bottom and the rescue played out as described by the people who were there.

 

A note on airbags:  While it has been shown that airbags are not all that effective in terrain traps like this one, I speculate that it was helpful in preventing a deeper burial.  My guess is that it made it easier for her to swim toward the trees, which in turn slowed her progress to the bottom, and allowed more snow to move passed her before she came to a rest.  More than likely, during the second part of the ride, she remain closer to the surface which also helped prevent a deeper burial.  Just my two cents.


This scenario is a common theme and can happen to even the most experienced backcountry travelers.  The lure of the deep Utah powder is strong and it can influence even the most experienced and cautious people.  The victim was very candid when I spoke with her and I want to thank her for sharing her experience.  It was a perfect outcome to a bad situation that we can all learn from.

Went towards the silver fork head wall to check it out. Ran across a slide that appeared to have happened the day before. There was a track, that appeared to be a skin track, at the top of the slide. There was a track on both sides of the slide. It appeared to have started right below the tree that's in the upper center portion of the photo. The slide ran to the bottom of the gulley though. Not sure how deep the debris was piled up but several feet deep. While attempting to get a closer look of the slide, a minor collapse was felt under my ski.

FORECASTER COMMENTS:  This little pocket was reported by another party who stumbled onto it as well.  They didn't trigger it but did dig a pit.  Comments from them below.

We were walking up Silver Fork yesterday afternoon (Sunday) and came across this small avalanche. It was difficult to tell when it had happened, but it looked fairly crisp and recent. Of significance was the slabs' characteristics as a hard slab, it's location above yet another major terrain trap, and it being on a common route out of silver fork. I dug a quick pit (the one in this other guy's photo) and found the weak layer to be the Thanksgiving Facets. Got an ECTX but a PST that resulted in likely propagation. Also of note my pit was not in the 'hard slab' as I was not into traveling that far into the slope. The slope was Northwest and 35degrees.

Sled problems prevented me from getting photos and a closer look, so this is all from the highway using binoculars.  Thinking a rider from the weekend triggered this avalanche low on the slope or from the side where the slab is thinner and weaker.  Looking back a few days on the winds from nearby Windy Peak and with plenty of loose snow on the surface to blow around, this slope was fairly wind loaded and waiting for a trigger.  This slope is very typical western Uintas with large open terrain on the windward side  where winds can grab lots of snow and deposit onto the leeward side.  The avalanche broke into weak snow near the ground, dirt and vegetation was easily seen on the bed surface. "

On the way from East Pass to Davenport Hill, one natural, soft slab avalanche was noted in a steep, north facing gully just skiers left of east pass, which appeared to have run this morning; the 30' wide, ~6"" deep crown, and the debris in the runout, was all covered by a few inches of new snow.  Additionally, I triggered an 8"" deep, 50' wide new snow, soft slab avalanche, from a safe spot on the ridge, in the next gully to the west, near the top of Davenport Hill.  Both of these slides appeared to have failed beneath the new snow on yesterday's faceted snow surface.

After cresting the top of Davenport hill, the next portion of ridgeline to the west was nearly snow free on the south side of the ridge, and I judged the north side of the ridge to be ""not steep enough to be a problem.""  My partner and I stopped for a moment, and I stated my feelings about the slope, and then walked onto it.  Staying very close to the ridge, I immediately felt the sandbox effect of a weak snowpack beneath this morning's snow, and after taking a couple steps, the avalanche broke at my feet.  The slab moved very slowly at first, and I was able to arrest on the bed surface, although the bed surface was so loose that I felt like I was treading water, well after the slab was off to the races below me. 

Overall, the slab was an average of 10""-12"" deep, with a couple portions stepping down into the late november facets, and one portion, on the eastern extremety of the slide, releasing near the ground, with the characteristic brown snow visible at the bottom of a ~three foot deep crown.  When I stood up, I measured the slope angle where I stood to be 32 degrees, although other portions of the bed surface measured exactly 36 degrees.  In places, this slab pulled out near the ridge on portions of ~30 degree terrain.  The debris ran through dense trees below me, and well onto the flats beneath the Silver Fork Headwall.  I called my friends in West Bowl who confirmed there was no one else in the area, and then called Alta Central.  

This was a close call--if I had entered the slope further to the east, where it is steeper, I would have been on a deeper portion of the slab and would likely have been strained through dense trees before riding a large debris pile to the flats.  It was similar to what has been, to my knowledge, my only other truly close call, in which I assumed my visual impression of a slope's steepness was correct, without having actually measured it previously, or personally seeing avalanches on the slope.  In both cases, i had made a deliberate assesment of terrain and snow conditions, and judged that I was about to do the right thing.  In both cases, I was in terrain I don't ski that much--not really a silver fork guy--but which I assumed could be navigated safely.

We recognized our weak layer as well developed facets (mid-november cold snap NSF) ~30cm from the surface with a well-bonded slab (made up of the pre-christmas rime/snow/graupel events) above it.  We decided that we felt safe moving along the lower-angle shoulder, expected the possibility of manageable avalanching, and ensured there was no one below before ski-cutting our shoulder.

I then skied (safe-spot to safe-spot) the shoulder's more northern and mellow slope and triggered a larger pocket that popped ~50' wide x 18"" deep and ran ~600' (full track).  The second slide sympathetically released a small pocket in the trees next to it as it moved slowly down slope.  Both ran near the ground on old November facets (buried deep) and left evidence in their bed surface of the buried dirt layer from earlier this fall.

The structure is the same that has has been thoroughly documented all throughout the Wasatch.  Very weak snow that has been sitting around for far too long is not buried under a 1 Finger hard wind slab that is strong enough to support its own weight but not much more.  The storm that is on our doorstep now is sure to tip the balanceon many slopes, but not all.

This small avalanche is a bit surprising given the low elevation as well as west aspect. In this part of the canyon though the winds tend to swirl and load terrain features like gullies and cut-banks.

Had nowhere to safely park but the slab seemed to be primarily storm snow and slid on the old snow interface.

Also saw some blown-in, small slides by Red Banks, another low elevation but east facing area.

The snow and winds started Saturday evening and didn't stop until Monday morning/early afternoon, and for a good portion of this multi-day storm the snow fell as graupel. Visibility was less than 1/4 mile. We stuck to low-angle slopes near Chicken Hill and White Pine Knob, and on Sunday the storm snow was pretty consistent and super fast. Sunday afternoon at about 4:45 pm we skied the ridge off the south side of the Knob, taking care to avoid the gut to skier's left. Partway down the ridge visibility cleared enough that we could see a 2-3' crown in the center/top of the Knob's southeast-facing gut. The slide was about 75' wide and traveled about 200' with mostly 2' chunks in the debris (which we couldn't see until Monday). It's possible that we triggered it remotely from the top of the Knob - we did hear several collapses during our hike - but because it looked like there was some new snow on top of the bed, we thought it was probably a natural slide.

In the first picture of the bigger slide, a snowmobiler was side-hilling at mid elevation on a hill.  On the left side of the slide you can see his tracks coming out of it.  He caused a lower slab to go which started small but then the lower slab caused all of the upper to go including the cornice.  We observed other large bowls with no snowmobile tracks in or out that had gone. This was only one of multiple avalanches we either triggered or observed. The 2nd and 3rd picture is an avalanche that ww triggered remotely from our snowmobiles. We were riding around 40 yards from where the slide actually occurred.  That one slid down to the weeds and covered the trail we had just ridden in on with about 7ft of snow.  Some occurred naturally and others from snowmobiles.  Both obvious and non obvious hills were sliding down to the dirt. In both cases I think the wind was a major factor in that the cornices were huge and the wind had blown large amounts of unstable snow below those cornices.  I believe that the first picture of the bigger slide is the tallest peak in that range so I'm guessing around 10k ft. In all cases we observed the slides went from the ridgeline all the way down. 
 In 20 years of snowmobiling it is by far the worst avalanche conditions I've ever witnessed. Extreme caution should be used in the Farmington area."

Of interest were a set of tracks from a skier and snowboarder who had descended into the area via the summit of Mt. Raymond through a gully that was west facing. Hard to tell it the riders were there yesterday (1/20) or on Sunday.

Debris pile was fresh so assume it ran Monday night or early today (Tuesday).

Looked at Scotts peak then decided to look into No Name because we new that was the place with the weakest snow structure, did not note any new activity in the bowl, dropped a few small cornices and only got some shallow new snow sluffs to run. Walked around the corner into the trees and dug a pit, the pit showed only 4 inches of new low density snow sitting on a fragile rain crust, with no slab just loose facets. Went back around the corner to No Name with the intentions of skiing it, noting not much of a new load or any wind effect and new the slope contained basically facets top to bottom with minimal amount or new snow. Brett went in first and noted a little bit if a slab in the very top section but 2 turns in he was in loose facets top to bottom with no slab, he skied the slope without incident. I dropped in next and made what I think was a mistake in judgment, instead of skiing to the skiers right of his tracks which was a bit lower angle, I opted for the steeper roll on skiers left side about 30ft down the slope I saw it fracture about 20ft above me and turned hard right and got off the slab, the slide washed by me and gouged down to the ground running to the transition zone and leaving a nice debris pile at the bottom. Fracture line was 5 to 11"" deep.  My thinking is that I hit a thin weak spot in the only place on the whole slope with a small slab on it, and the debris pile was so large because it cleaned out all the hang fire from the last slide I triggered in there a couple weeks ago, and cleaned out all the facets to the ground in the whole path except for the top of the starting zone. It was actually some what of a user friendly slide if that is possible. I think I hit the only sweet spot in the whole bowl that you could trigger an avalanche in. The words spacial variability, and pockety come in mind when i think about it. Traveled all the way to Mill D from there with no other activity noted.

FORECASTER COMMENTS:  As we started the day, we anticipated a significant danger and had no intentions of skiing No Name.  However, it quickly became apparent the storm didn't produce as expected and conditions were less dangerous.  We were finding 4 to 5 inches of loose new snow, very little wind effect.  We decided the loose new snow sitting on the old loose facets was not a dangerous situation.  This was the case.  However, we underestimated the amount of new snow that had drifted enough to produce the pocket that Mark triggered.  The pocket itself was not all that scary, basically a moderate sized drift.  However, what we both noted was the large pile of debris formed from the initial slab gouging into facets and entraining snow as it traveled all the way down the slope.  As Mark noted, this situation is not all that likely right now.  Most areas just didn't get the load.  Mark and I have a good amount of experience and it should be noted that we made an error in judgment here.  Ultimately, not a significant event but any avalanche unintentionally triggered while you're on the slope is too many. - Kobernik

The lower more significant rime crust that formed on Jan 11 was still intact below the bed surface. It did not travel far, only running to the first transition in slope angle but if the slope was bigger I think it would easily have run farther.

In fact a few years ago I triggered a large slide in the exact same spot and went for a relatively long ride.

Below are comments about the accident which are based on my opinion.

I believe this was a case of 'innocent ignorance' as I suspect no one in the party had any idea that they were in avalanche terrain.  This is not to say they are stupid, just unaware.  It is easy to think this way with the avalanche site so close to the road.  However, all you need is a steep enough slope with snow on it and you're in avalanche terrain, no matter how close to a road or civilization you are.

I regularly spend time doing field work in the Provo area mountains and it is not uncommon to see snowshoers or snowshoe tracks in the bottom of gullies.  Many of these gullies are fairly small and seem unassuming to someone who has no avalanche education.  Also, they are often the path of least resistance for traveling so it is understandable why we see people in these gullied 'terrain traps'.

Investigated an unreported avalanche with significant debris.  Although slope is relatively small it ends in a terrain trap with many trees.
Upon investigation looked as if a solo skier was traversing underneath a steep slope when he triggered a large slab that ran on the Jan. 10th rain crust.  There was one track in and one track out so it look as if skier miraculously was able to ski off of the slab.  If he had been caught a full burial would have been likely.
Of note, the skier triggered avalanche looks to be responsible for a sympathetic release around the corner off of the same ridge.  The sympathetic avalanche was just as large and also ran on the rain crust on a more northeast aspect.  A large area of undisturbed snow in between the two avalanches.  More proof that the weak layer, slab, and bed surface (rain crust) is continuous and well connected.

Forecaster Comments:  

Backcountry skiers intentionally triggered a large cornice that rolled to the lower part of the slope and triggered a very large avalanche in West Monitor that took out the entire season's snowpack to the ground.  Here are comments from the skiers who triggered it:

After making sure no people were in the run a friend and I kicked off a truck size cornice while on belay. The cornice ran down to the bottom of the bowl and triggered a very large avalanche once it reached the bottom. The avalanche broke all the way to the ground and ran full track.

Regardless of the trigger, the ""West"" slide is significant just due to how rare it is for this slope to slide.  The 1F hard slab pulled out to the ground, leaving huge refrigerator sized chunks littered across the slope.  This slope is just a hundred yards or so due south of the weather station on a northerly, treed slope.

The crown averaged 4 feet but was up nearly 6 feet in some spots.  It failed just 6-10"" above the ground on basal facets/depth hoar.  It appears that the failure layer was just above or below a very thin rime crust (date of crust unknown).  

Slope angle was mostly 32-34 degrees along the starting zone, but did have a small area as steep as 40 degrees.  There was lots of crevasse-like cracking on the adjacent lower angle terrain.  This is not a slope that I would typically expect to see an avalanche on, much less one this deep sliding to the ground.  It really got our attention.

Thankfully, their tracks ended up descending into Toledo bowl. Not sure if they had set it off with cornice drop or the like, but neither me or my partner noticed any disturbance in the snow near the ridge.  We decided to traverses east to Emma 2.

Forecaster comment- Ted found this large natural during his travels in Whitney Basin on Mon. Feb. 17. We tried to pinpoint when it possibly occurred. Westerly winds have dominated since the very active zonal pattern developed in early January. This pattern tends to strip snow from Superbowl. However, looking back at Windy Peak wx data, southwest winds made their first appearance late in the evening of the 15th and blew into the 40's and 50's for 13 hours, essentially sealing the fate for a very weak, fragile snowpack. 

Ted Scroggin knows the Uinta's like no one else and is a valuable member of the Utah Avalanche Center. Many thanks to Ted for having the intuition to sniff this one out... does this guy rock or what?

It was a Storm Slab/Wind Slab made more sensitive and cohesive as a result of wind loading. This was a Soft Slab of 4 finger hardness. It was a D2.5 in size. The victims' partner then proceeded to initiate another slide in the chute to the riders right of the aforementioned slide. He did not go for a ride. The total width of these two slides was approximately 350 feet, and the combined runouts were tied together as they came out of the cliff bands. This and many other slides appeared to have a weak layer that was just above the old snow interface, and it was a mixture of grauple and precip particles that had rimed stellars and light density snow. The initial snow that fell at the beginning of the latest event appeared to bond, yet after this first wave of high density/warm precip, there was a period when colder snow grains fell. At lower elevations, there was more grauple in the initial first 4 to 5 inches. Photos of this slide on the previous report by Kellen. His picture was better than mine.

Also observed was an 85 foot wide slide in the Chutes below the Wolverine Bowl. The riders right chute was also human triggered and it broke out approximately 100 feet/6 turns down the the slope. It was hard to tell if the victim went for a ride or was able to escape. It propagated as it descended just like all the other slides observed. As it broke out of the chute it propagated out below the cliff lines that form the chute. This slide as well as all others ran well into the flats...much longer that would be expected. It was approximately 12 to 14 inches deep and was a D1.5 in size.  

Slope cuts in the morning hours were yielding easy shears and fractures in the new snow only on slopes with angles > 35 degrees.

The good riding conditions experienced in the morning hours changed significantly after 1230 when there was an impulse that came through with Moderate to Strong Winds out of the SW; and this was accompanied with off and on precip, and Intense Blowing Snow. At that point the snowpack became upside down in almost all terrain, and this was exacerbated in any areas that were receiving even Light Winds. At least 5 naturals were observed in the Wolverine Cirque, with the Y Chute (aka Grannies) running in both nostrils. These were triggered by small cornice falls. And, this particular slide ran at least 150 feet on the low angle/flat moraine runout. After viewing this slide from the Peak of Wolverine an attempt was made to take a closer look at the crowns and possibly descend down the Y Chute. Due to rapid reloading and confirmation of the excessive nature of the runouts observed this mission was abandoned. Photos taken of this slide and the Wolverine Bowl slide were not of good quality due to the flat light, cloud cover and precip. 

During the last part of the afternoon there were extreme sensitivities observed on all aspects, with those receiving even limited wind loading exhibiting unusual highly sensitive results. These heightened conditions included terrain at mid elevations. Cracking was observed on 25 degree slopes with slab failures of one finger hardness on slopes of 30 degrees, and these avalanches were propagating around terrain features into adjoining gullies and chutes. 

Hazard in the mid to late afternoon escalated to High

A lot of folk out today looking at the debris from a close up viewpoint, I assume more details will trickle in.  My dimensions are a guess.

This is a great example of how conditions can change in a short period of time!

We didn't hang out to check out the crown or bed surface as we were working against the sun and the heat on our climb.

Although it was a small one, it definitely wouldn't have been a fun ride if it had taken you off your feet, and could well have happened in much higher consequence terrain.

I didn't notice or think about the fat pillows to the side of the run.  I originally planned to ski through the steep section very fast, but tagged a rock turning into the chute which triggered the instinct to put in a couple of hard turns to slow down.  It felt very good to get my avalung in my mouth and pop up with good visibility after tumbling a few times.

Notably, had felt as though there would be small micro-wind-slab pop due to increasing angle and slight slope buldge and wind loaded snow appearance and close proximity to rideg line.  Even with awareness of these factors, made decision to move across and ascend to ridge due to general stubornness, desire to attain pre-meditated goal, and probably most importantly, the general benign nature terrain below combined with confidence in my decision that what would pop, if anything. would be very small.

Skied down bed surface a bit and with my pal, Ferg, inspected the make up of this event.  Conclusions drawn on hill and now upon a half day's worth of reflection: the Thursday/Friday storm snow settled (heat and wind) and then the wind blew and it loaded.  Bingo.

Take aways: 1) Humbling. 2) Familiarity with slope/location/terrain, while nice in theory and conversation, invites error.  3) Minimizing the signs you see, say for the sake of getting somewhere (i.e. summit for a view) with a pal on a familiar slope, invites further error.  4) Overselling in one's mind the deep stabilty of spring, you guessed it, invites error.

Initially I thought it was just slough but as I glanced back I noticed it was a slab and it was picking up some steam.  I pointed it and got off to the side to a safe zone and watched as it rolled down the middle of the line we were about to ride.  The slab was shallow, probably only 4” deep but was probably 50’ wide at the widest section.   It traveled around 600 vertical feet down the mountain and plowed through some trees and piled up nicely (maybe 4’ deep at it’s deepest).  Probably wouldn’t have been enough to fully bury a person but would have made for a scary ride down.      "

This time of year I enjoy walking up the west ridge of the Birthday Chutes to the summit of Red Top.  If need-be, a relatively safe descent can be made following the ridge and skinner back to the White Pine road.  There are a couple short, steep pitches one has to navigate before you get on the ridge that I thought would be manageable in the current danger.  We broke trail from the road and the shady snow was good.  Higher, we were skinning up the ridge on generally wind-hammered snow when, at the location of the X in the illustration, I had a crack shoot out from my skis.  I could see that the whole slope to my left had spiderwebbed, but not moved.  As we (party of two) were marveling at the collapse, we saw a powder cloud shoot out from the bottom of the westernmost Bday chute.  It had slid wall-to-wall, to the ground, basically removing the entirely of the snowpack from the length of the chute.  No other chutes slid to our knowledge. The collapse must have propagated 150-200 feet to cause this. The debris piles were large, with big chunks of windboard in it.  As usual, the strong SW winds were loading this slope and I suspect this made the danger locally higher.  In the illustration the blue line is our skinner, the red line outlines the collapsed area, and the red hash indicates areas that slid.  A large area that was probably near 30 deg didn't slide.  

One thing I have been thinking about since the seriously unstable snow last weekend is whether or not one can look at a spiderwebbed slope as being as safe as an avalanched one.  If the fracture has already propagated across it, can you cause an avalanche by then riding it?  My intuition says 99% of the time this is true.  But not 100%.  Is this proof that the slope is not steep enough to slide?  I am guessing that with these slides failing on the ground, the friction of the bed surface is relatively high, and just because the slope didn't totally fail this time, doesn't mean that with a smooth suncrust as a bed surface it might not slide then.  We took the most conservative route down to avoid testing these questions.

On our 4th run, one of our party skied between the Goal Posts, toward the gully beneath Hanky Panky. The slide broke at his feet on the thin, rocky rollover and looked to have pulled up 150 feet and all the way across Hanky Panky to the far edge of the main Gulley. The slide came in two pieces, two clouds. The skier caught was one of the most experienced backcountry skiers at the Canyons and one of the best skiers. He managed to stay on top of the wash and was buried to his neck. Our party dug him out. He's fine. I went back up to inspect but getting to the crown at that time had too much exposure.

 

Additional info from the party: Myself and a group of 4 others were laping Dutches draw around 1:30pm. We had made several runs in a section called ""Hanky panky"", just north of ""movie line trees"". As we started migrating more and more skiers left I made the unfortunate decision to ski a line called ""goal post"". this line runs along a ridge that is more convex and becomes steeper, approaching 42 degrees in spots. My plan was to ski the right side of the subridge and avoid most the steeper more exposed section; giving me an escape route to skiers right. as I skied through the two trees that goal post is named after, I didn't notice any fracturing at the time but the snowpack was noticeably thin and faceted. Visibility was poor, but it is our belief that the avalanche started there in the weaker facets under the new snow, and quickly propagated and stepped down to the ground. It is important to note that the Avalanche didn't strike me like a NFL linebacker till I was 1/2 the way down the slope, leading me to believe that it didn't fracture till I was already well below the starting point. I made a number of mistakes and ignored some obvious red flags over the last couple days. Suspect pits, natural avalanches close by and on similar aspects, noted snow ""whomping"" and the UAC report, all should have been clear signals to back off. I'm just glad all ended well enough, and I had a great group of partners to dig me out.

Slide was triggered by small air onto slope (Picture 2) from the skiers left rib into the left center of the second bowl (more northerly) in Wilson Glades. First skier was not part of group and had center punched steepest section of the bowl. Second skier was at the base of the slope and experience a loud settling and whump. Slide looks to have been triggered by the energy of third skier landing on the wind slab over 1/2 way down the 400' slope. The slab fractured approx. 100' across the slope to the south-east across the bowl. We reason that the 150' of slope above the trigger point then slid sympathetically. Bed surface was early December snow pack that had decomposed, but was supportable to a persons weight. A bit of stomping on the base surface showed that it was poorly bonded. Approximately 2.5-3' of the snow pack slid, while the total snowpack depth was 4' (Picture 3). The slab was the recent wet storm (Dec . 22nd) and was not particularly firm (4F) and roughly 15-18"" thick (Picture 4). The rime layer was apparent within the slab and was approx. 3 mm thick. Weak layer was December near surface faceted snow (Picture 5), but showed some cohesion and was not typical ""sugar snow"". Majority of the slope was between 32-33 degrees with isolated pockets of 35 degree slopes. A number of the slide blocks remained on the slope attesting to the general low-angle of the slope. Slide initiated in a steep pocket showing that a little extra energy even in an isolated steep section among a lower angle slope can wake up the deep slab monster. Debris pile was 6-10' thick in the deepest parts and would have drug a caught skier through trees. Would have not been a pleasant rescue. Whole thing was a bit sobering and in retrospect we still feel good about the decision to ski in that area. This just brings to light how unstable the pack really is right now. Moving forward it is time to reassess what we consider ""low angle""."

My partner was partly in the lee of a tree and I did a quick kick turn to try to lunge towards him but it was a fairly futile effort.  Fortunately we were on the flank of the slide and trees above probably broke the power a bit, so the snow washed over me without too much oomph and I only traveled a few feet.  Had I gone further I would have likely gone into a debris pile at a flatter spot above some trees (where my one ski ended up) that wasn’t that deep.  However, out in the more-open terrain to skinner’s left the debris ran far and fast, and we think that it likely ran all the way down the slab shot below. 

 

The thrust of the energy was on the more-easterly aspect; ie NOT on the GLM side and more on the Craig’s Chute side.  Possibly due to the NW windloading from yesterday?  It ran on the facet layer that – where we were – was 3’ deep.  We did not carry on up higher to check out the top crown, but we could see quite a ways up and the remote trigger distance was impressive.  And it appeared to propagate pretty far to the south across those chutes. 

 

Most disconcerting was that there were approximately 13 sets of tracks in that area, and it had been skied (not much) yesterday.  As everyone knows who has skied the last few days, the skiing was sublime, and it certainly didn’t “feel” like we were floating on a hard slab that was ready to run. We had no other signs of instabilities; the new snow was sloughing a little in the steeper trees but was barely noticeable, and a quick hand/pole pit - only about 2 feet deep, and not down to the facet layer, as it turns out - did not indicate any unusual instabilities.  

 

Of note:  most of the skin track was unaffected; ie the typical skin line up to the point where it starts to feel “real’ (steepness) was indeed in the safety zone relative to this particular slide.  However, most of the upper skin track was taken out.   We skied the bed surface down a ways and then realized that we should cut over to the skin line because the other party we had seen may have been ascending and gotten swept down and maybe a rescue might be necessary, but zigzagging deep in the old growth they were blissfully unaware that anything had happened.  Of course, the last few hundred feet of the skinner takes one out of that safer zone and into steeper, more-open terrain where the slide occurred.

Comments by the party that triggered the slide: 
I was standing on the summit of Murdock Peak today around noon and as the second skier approached the summit (elevation 9,600 ft) we heard a collapse that resulted in a shooting crack that propagated eastward resulting in the sympathetic release of of a wind-slab pocket , skier's right of Todd's Bowl (towards Dirt Chute). Although we didn't visibly see the avalanche crown because the ridgeline obscured our sight and we were in a hurry due to a south exit and increasing temperatures, we did see the the debris run down the slope through the spruce/fir. By the amount of debris we could tell it was not a large avalanche. I know some of the people that read this are going to say WTF?, you're reporting an avalanche and you don't know the size? The bottom line is two skiers standing on the Murdock ridge (estimated weight 320 lbs) caused an audible collapse that resulted in a shooting crack on the surface that ran 100 ft east and triggered a sympathetic pocket hardslab avalanche, immediately below the ridgeline, about 25 feet vertical feet below and 100 feet right of us. To quote Fesler I would say that's bull's eye. We avoided the open bowl and skied the north ridge so we weren't in any danger."

It's possible that this is a repeater based on the thin snow cover and the looks of the profile.  But in poking around on many similar slopes on the forest edge the snowpack structure looks similar.  So we're not sure...

Bed surface is a crust, supportable.

Partner skied hangfire without incident.  We skied bed, debris (old and new) and flanks into Alexanders without further incident.

Slide fanned out a bit when it exited the couloir. It did not entrain any snow on the sides of the couloir.

Of Note: 

Most east facing Gobblers into Alexanders ran during the last storm.  There were large debris piles at the base of this run as well as Depth Hoar bowl.  (the snow in these piles was soft).These piles were not there prior to the last storm. Everything looked thin (bushes) and we had assumed that we would be dealing with only a partial accumulation of new snow from the last event.  Based on the height of the crown (8-10"") this appears to have been correct.  The snow on west facing Gobblers was deeper (12-14').  This was a repeater in respect to the last storm.

We did know about the slide on Toots from the previous day and assumed that most of the new snow instability had settled out.  This is a good case of not abiding by the ""one red flag trumps all signs/theories of stability"".

Slope angle is at crown, slope is steeper in the neck of the couloir.

I am going to quote Kimbrough ""you gotta have a close call once in a while to keep you on your toes""

I went in to investigate on the 18th and concluded that it was a skier triggered, soft slab avalanche triggered in a steep rocky chute near the summit though details are unclear. The slide ran like a sluff in loose snow for approximately 900' before reaching a steep convexity at the top of a gully where it propagated into a hard persistent slab, fracturing to the ground at a depth of 4'.

Distance and shade prevented seeing actual ski tracks in the starting zone, but a pair of tracks were observed high on the observers right of the broad open face. These tracks eventually made their way down through complex terrain to the observers right of the slide path eventually exiting the area near the debris at the bottom. 

Weather conditions were calm and sunny at the time with NE winds blowing in the single digits. Temperatures at 10,000' were in the low 30's.

Two local skiers were skiing in Tele Gold just prior to the slide and they exited via the observers left side of Tele Heaven sometime between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. The slide was first observed right around 3:00 and the skiers tracks in Tele Heaven were partially covered by the debris. 

This slope is rarely skied in mid winter and access is difficult. The presence of ski tracks on the slope and the lack of avalanche producing weather conditions lead me to conclude that it was a skier triggered avalanche.

Weakness in question is from the 2/9 storm that began with graupel and followed with roughly three more inches of snow.  The snow above the graupel faceted under clear skies over the next 11 days until it was buried on the 20th with 6-10"" of snow.  This wasn't enough to activate the layer until this past few days of storms which brought 2-3' of snow since 2/26.

Our party of 3 experienced backcountry skiers set out just before 0500, skinned up Argenta, skied a mellow line on the Catcher's mitt, booted up the East Couloir, and opted to ski back down Argenta instead of the East Couloir for much better snow quality. We descended the ridge west from the top of Kessler, careful not to dip into the steep terrain on either side. As I was skiing the trees of the ridge around 10,000ft, I hit a rock garden that had been covered by the new snow. This caused me to lose my ski and fall onto the low 30s degree angle slope which rolled over into a slope which appproached 40 degrees much further downhill. I stood up and began probing for my ski, which appeared to have torpedoed about 5 feet below me. I stepped a few feet below where I had landed--I would guess that the slope was 35 degrees at that point--and felt the slab begin to slide beneath me. It broke out 3-5 feet above where I was standing. Luckily, I was standing by a tree and was able to grab onto a limb, which allowed me to pull myself up while the ground gave way. The other members in my party were luckily still on the ridge and out of the way. The slab was quite cohesive consolidated new snow. The interface at which it slid did not appear faceted or rotten. It broke out around 50 feet across and funneled down over a large cliff. The impact of the avalanche falling over the cliff propagated another slide, with a crown that appeared to be 4-5 feet. I watched from above and shouted warnings as I saw the slides continuing downhill. As we were not sure if anyone had been caught or carried, my two partners left me quickly and found a safe way down to the debris. There they encountered a party of two who watched the slide and did not believe there were any other parties ascending or descending between us. My partners performed a beacon search and found no buried persons. 
As one of my partner's phone was dead and the other on airplane mode, I no longer had contact with them and I did not know whether there were any injured parties. As such, I snapped a few quick pictures of the crown, but did not have time to thoroughly investigate it. I descended via the skin track on one ski until I reached mellower terrain (apologies to anyone skinning up later...). I reached my partners at the base of the debris and saw that the other two parties were approaching the lower, 4-5 foot crown to investigate (perhaps they will post photos). 

Note: if anyone finds a BD Amperage ski with Dynafit bindings in the debris, I would love it back. Please contact UAC if found. Beer and good karma in it for you!

My take on the incident:
The same three skiers in our party lapped Cardiff peak yesterday and noticed some mild sluffing underfoot and also visualized moderate soft slab natural avalanches on two trees. We were aware of the rapid loading which took place and knew the avi forecast well, and knew that there was potential for activity today. We checked out the dawn patrol forecast and were aware of the recent natural avalanche cycles down south and potential for slab activity on steep north-facing slopes. We planned to ski the Catcher's Mitt and did so at the lower angle route. We planned to ride the ridge from Kessler west until we reached more moderate terrain before dropping in. I had no intentions of skiing where the avalanche occurred. I was incredibly fortunate to have a tree beside me which I was able to grab onto. Otherwise I may well have ended up at the bottom of a very large cliff. I did not expect the new snow interface to give so easily and on a relatively moderate roll-over, but the steeper terrain below the rollover was sufficient to release the slab. I considered the risk of descending another few feet to retrieve my ski, and felt that an avalanche was highly unlikely based on this action. I was wrong.

Lessons: We saw red flags today: recent loading, evidence of natural avalanches out in the distance in Broad's fork. There was no collapsing or cracking that I noticed, and no slides apart from gentle sluffs and warm releases of of Kessler. I knew there were pockets of considerable and unfortunately I literally fell right into one. It turns out that trying to make smart decisions with regards to route choice only works most of the time, and you need to be prepared for the worst and hope to get lucky if badness happens.
One of my partner's injured her knee in the backcountry a couple months ago and required extrication. A few of us were able to splint her leg, keep her warm, and extricate her using skins, skis, cordelette, athletic and duct tape, and Voile-style ski straps. Because of accidents like that, I always carry extra layers, an emergency bivy, ski straps, tape, and pain meds. I feel that had there been an injury or burial, my party would have been prepared to respond.
One thing that could have gone better, however, is communication. With phones not working, it was impossible to communicate. This underscores the essential need to carry either a phone or radio that is functional. UAC's iPhone App was awesome for pulling up Alta Central and UAC numbers to report the incident.

Thanks to UAC for all your life-saving work."

While it did have some blocky avalanche debris, I cannot confirm that the slab was 1F or harder.  I will call it a SS-ASu-R2-D2 that failed on what appeared to be 1.5mm facets on a North aspect at about 10k. Around 100ft wide, ran about 700ft and the crown depth was up to 3ft. Due to it breaking into old faceted snow we believe it was a Persistent Slab. 


          On the drive to LCC we made persistent slabs our number one concern today in the terrain we were traveling. We looked past a number of warning signs. These included finding a thin rocky snowpack on the entrance (facets), the fact that Mongo No had already slid this year, and seeing many avalanches on similar aspects and elevations. (Although we categorized those as storm/wind slabs that likely lost the energy by today.) We counted eight avalanches just from our view from the top of Mongo No. Just that alone should have kept us on more conservative terrain. We though that the structure was better than it was, and that there was less energy in the snowpack. We were wrong, the structure in that spot and I assume in many other rocky areas in Mineral was weaker than we figured.  This was also our third run of the day and I feel we had too much confidence brewing. Triggered from the skiers right flank of the slide.  

          I was able to ski off the slab and out of harms way but the side was in unforgiving terrain and I was lucky. Booted up and out of that terrain and went down a lower angle slope that had a fatter and stronger snowpack where we stayed the rest of the day. Credit goes to UAC for the accurate forecast of persistent slab problem on high east aspects for the morning of 3/4/15. ​

We carefully ski cut the slope, and got the ~1"" wind crust to move but with very little propagation.  A few careful turns later, I felt a layer ~6"" underneath the surface buckle and start to move.  Easy to ski out of, but eventually the slide entrained enough snow to easily move a person.

Investigating the slide path, it was easy to see places where the slide stepped down into the old snow.  We didn't do a formal analysis of the layers involved.  

Takeaways are that wind has definitely been moving snow and forming slabs, be extra vigilant around ridges or any steeper slope affected by the wind, and be very concerned when new snow comes.

Picture below shows the top ~100 feet of the path.  Note the obvious points where the slide stepped down into deeper layers."

Also of interest, bed surface was completely white -- didn't see any grass, rocks, brush, or cone flowers sticking up which I would take to mean that the slide broke half way down through the snow pack (rather than on the bed facets). Since timing is unknown, alternatively, the slide could have ran during the last storm cycle and new accumulation covered the bed. The slide looked fresh/recent though. Based on the weather (see below), I think the slide was recent and caused by wind loading.

Weather today was calm in the canyon but extremely windy on the Little Baldy ridge. Above DB and Exit, wind was out of the SE. Lots of snow transport and loading N/NW aspects such as the face of DB that slid. Near and on the ridge, there were extremely variable conditions that ranged from beautiful, soft settled powder, to complete scour, to soft wind slabs 1"" thick that broke in cookie crumble pieces with no energy while skinning, to hard wind slabs up to 5"" thick that broke in chair to desk sized pieces with a bit of energy.

Sluffing off the cliffs from above combined with the 12 inches of new snow, and it overloaded the weak layer, and ran on the old firm bed surface from the slide that released during the Christmas Avalanche Cycle. This slide was a Storm Slab Avalanche with a Persistent Weak Layer as a contributing factor. 

Of Note, the steep rider's left entrance at the top of Stupid Chute had a well defined Soft Slab fracture similar to the widespread cycle that occurred early Friday morning, and this may have also played a roll in sympathetically triggering the much deep soft slab previously described. 

Other areas observed that had this 6 to 8 inch Soft Slab activity included: Rider's left wall above 100 turn gully, areas of the XY Chutes, small area in Rocky Points east facing, Lower Wolverine Chutes East facing, and a WNW small pocket on rider's right side of Sunset. All of these slides observed were repeaters from the Christmas Cycle, and the NSF's that formed during the dry and cold week after Christmas were the weak layers involved.

There did not appear to be a very cohesive storm slab, and the facets on the ground were wet and could be balled up. The bed surface was essentially the ground, though a small crust persisted in various places at the ground throughout the bowl by small hand pits up high. I speculated incorrectly that the slab was not dense or cohesive enough to be an issue, especially since the facets were wet. I skied the far skiers right flank and after 3-4 turns a small soft slab popped out behing me. Saw the stauchwall just behind me and easily skier to the right out of harms way. Very slow moving initially, then it gathered some speed. Probably would not have buried you, but could have injured a person. Perhaps the wind and spindrift off the cliffs created a bit more of a slab, and also the more westerly, almost southwesterly aspect of the right side of this shot may have created  more of a small crust for this repeater to pop out on.

Forecaster note:  It has been reported that this is a repeater, and the slope had slid earlier this season.

Posting this observation as I haven't seen one yet from the party caught -- they may update. Our party of two was skiing north from the west shoulder of Lookout Peak above Pinecrest. We'd spent most of the day skiing further west on the ridgeline. The snowpack that direction was fairly dense, with the new snow having settled significantly. We did not see any significant cracking, sluffs, or collapsing. As the afternoon went on the weather turned worse, with winds from the SE picking up along the ridge line. Heading up the shoulder of Lookout Peak we encountered a party of 4 and could see the skin track of another party of two ahead of us. A short distance west of the summit we transitioned and decided to ski the trees to the north. We did notice some wind slabs that cracked fairly easily on the ridge, but that was not present just below. A little ways down there is a rollover to the left, and a less steep glade to the right. I went right, the skiing was excellent in there, much lighter than farther down the ridge. Upon stopping around 300' down I Iooked back to my skiers left and saw the crown of a soft slab that had broken right down to the ground interface at the point of the rollover. I thought at first that I'd triggered it remotely. My partner arrived shortly after and moving over to the slide path we called out and got a response from a party of two. They said they were OK, but the person caught had lost both skis. They were working on making their way back up with the party behind trying to walk on the tails of the other's skis. We turned around and cut a skin track back to the ridge along a more mellow angle. During this time the party of 4 came upon the scene and they feared we had been caught and buried -- all accounted for and no injuries we continued to the ridge. The party of four attempted to search the debris field for the missing skis, but felt a significant collapse, and exited. From the ridge two of that party had the good idea of taking my skis back down. Two of us stayed on the ridge line, the rest went back down to reach the party of two and guide them back up our skin track. Winds continued to increase, there was definitely snow moving to the leeward north slope, which may have been a contributing factor in the slide. Ultimately, all parties reached the ridge. The party of two caught in the slide decided to go one ski each and make their way down that way. Meanwhile another group was coming up from pinecrest with a pair of skis. We continued with them to a sheltered point just before you head down into the pinecrest gully. That's where we left the group. We met the party headed up with the extra skis on the way down. Just one picture of the slide crown, but you can see it broke down to the facets on the ground. Glad no one was hurt. And, nice to see three different groups of skiers work together to help out.

I skied skier's left (SE), on the mellower terrain, off of White Pine Nob and stopped on a little balcony above the rollover in order to observe two snowboarder intending to run the S gully. The first boarder rode the gully and according to his words triggered a small slab right at the rollover (steepest part / rocky bedsurface). I did not see this small slide but, saw how this break then propagated and released the larger avalanche. The release of the larger avalanche seemed to be a bit delayed, so that the snowboarder was well out of the avalanche's path by the time it reached the runout zone. The second snowboarder and another skier came down after the avalanche stopped. 

The center and E part of the slide seemed to have broken near the ground in the faceted layer, the part on the W seemed to have broken at the old/new snow interface. The crown of the avalanche followed the ~SE ridge for some distance and totaled about 250 '. Crown depth was about 2'. The avalanche ran for about 300'. The accumulation of a mix of hard and soft slab was about 4' (a wild guess) deep.

I was skiing the skiers right side of the comma bowl tight to the trees which has a more gentle slope, about 32 degrees.  further to the left the slope angle gets up to 35 to even 37 degrees, which is where the photo shows the slide broke out.   I skied the entire steeper part of my run in dry powder and was turning on the flatter portion of the run (25 degrees) when i was hit from behind first with soft snowballs then i heard the rush of the avalanche.  I made a last turn to the left before i was hit, which fortunately got me out of the middle of the slide path.  The slide took both skis off instantly and i began to swim,  always able to see daylight.  the slide carried me only 50 to 75 feet before it stopped.  i ended up with my head and arms above the snow and unhurt. The tong of the slide stopped about 100' below me.

I yelled for my partner John who yelled back.  We thought we were alone, but with 5 minutes a party of two other skiers appeared out of the trees to the skiers right, then 5 minutes after that  a party of 5 appeared.

My belief is that the slide was remotely triggered by myself once i skied the steeper part of the run as my partners skied to my right and more in the trees.  I don't know what the role of other parties skinning above might have played.  if they were skinning in the same up track that my partner had set there would have been no possible chance that they could have triggered the slide.

Thanks to the assistance of the two parties i was able to get out of the situation, with one person bring a pair of skis down that i could skin up the up track and two other friends relaying a pair of skis up from a friend in Pinecrest.  My partner and i did manage to ski on one ski off the top  500 vertical of lookout and then waited for the rescue skis to get to us.

General Comments: We got away with a very bad decision today without suffering any consequences.  After multiple great runs on Chicken Shit Ridge (CSR), we decided to exit via the skier's left side of Days Draw.  We knew it had run to the ground Dec. 23rd and there were still weak facets.  Our thinking was there was about 2 feet of snow sitting on top of the ground and there was no evidence of a slab.  There was no wind effect on any of the snow in the area and we had seen no cracking or settlement or any other signs of instability.  There were two sets of tracks from the previous day on the right side of Days Draw.  By the end of the day, the 9 people from 3 parties had made a lot of tracks on CSR, so the uncut snow on Days Draw was very appealing.  We have skied this slope many many times over the years and knew the terrain very well.  We discussed the potential risks and decided to proceed.  As you can see/hear in the video, our biggest concern was hitting rocks in the shallow snow near the top of the run.  We thought we might get some loose snow sluffs but expected them to be manageable.

 

I went first and hit a rock on my second and 4th turns.  When I was about 200 vertical feet down the slope I saw the slope begin to shatter like a window pane beneath my skis and to my left.  I skied off to the right and stopped.  The avalanche released about 100-150 vertical feet above me, was about 70-100 feet wide and it rocketed down the slope which is about 35-38 degrees in that area.  The upper-most crown was on a slight convex part of the slope.  The ground and some remaining old facets were the bed surface.  It entrained quite a bit of snow, gathered a lot of speed and plowed into the trees below.  It plastered some of the tree trunks to a height of about 6 feet (see photo) and ran 450 vertical feet down the slope.

 

At the place where I stopped the snow did not go downhill, but there were numerous cracks in the snow.  After the avalanche went by, I immediately traversed onto the bed surface of rocks and old facets.  I could see there really wasn't much snow left above me so I felt safe on the bed surface.  Between me and the top of the slope was mostly rocks, so my two companions could not descend the bed surface to me, and we felt the snow that had not slid yet, was very likely to slide if they attempted to descend in the snow adjacent to the avalanche path.  My companions put their skins back on and walked back to the top of the ridge and descended CSR.

 

From where I was standing I could see the slide had run all the way to a bench a few hundred vertical feet below me.  I knew there was little avalanche danger on the much more gentle terrain below the bench and felt that it was safer for me to descend than to attempt to gain the ridge through the hang fire and rocks.  I side slipped and skied the bed surface and debris to the bench and then skied to the bottom and met my companions.

 

I’ve included a photo of the crown, a photo of the bed surface which was mostly rocks and facets, a photo looking down the path at the snow plastered on some trees, a photo looking across the width of the slide, and a photo of the toe located 450 vertical feet below the crown.

 

The avalanche is very difficult to see in the video, but the 1 minute video does provide some sense for how far down the slope I was when the avalanche broke out above me.  In the video, you can see when I stopped skiing as the slope was breaking up.

 

Again, we completely underestimated the likelihood of a slab on this slope and I’m feeling very fortunate we didn’t suffer any consequences for our poor judgement.

I was up in this area with my pals from the UDOT snow safety team about a week ago during the high pressure.  We all noted how weak the snow was in this area.  Both the surface and near the ground had weak faceted snow and we speculated that it was weak enough that it wouldn't hold much weight from new snow storms.  Looks like our assumptions were right.  It was difficult to see the initial fracture but the avalanche definitely ended up gouging to the ground as it ran.  Wind drifting no doubt played a role here.

We didn't really guess on how much water it would take before avalanches occurred but I attempted to measure it today.  It was a bit difficult due to how much the wind had stirred things up but my rough measurements were 14.5"" of snow over the last week on top of the old faceted snow surface.  The 14.5"" of snow contained about 1.6"" of water.

Of note, the paths that threaten the road lower in the canyon still don't hold much total snow.  At the forks of the Huntington I measured 6"" that fell over the last week.  It contained .47"" water.

My first cornice kick gave me a small reaction on a South facing slope, 8"" deep, 30 feet wide, and nearly 100 feet long of a medium density wind slab). Not high energy, but the cornice section that fell and triggered it was only about microwave sized.

The next one I got to and kicked broke about 10"" deep, 80 feet wide, and ran out 200 feet. As that one went, it another slide that was a bit deeper and wider broke about 200 feet away towards Sunset peak. I don't know if it was sympathetic or natural and the timing was coincidental.

Maybe 20 or 30' wide and not much energy. Decided they were manageable and after clearing out the top of our line, dropped one the mellower shots into the bowl. 

First skiier triggered a crack maybe 70' down the slope. Still looked fairly benign, consequences were low, so the second skier dropped and caused the soft slab to scoot down about 15'. Third and forth individuals descended the same line with no reactivity from the slab-- the angle was too low and the slab didn't have enough energy. It was 35-40' across, 5"" deep and only ran maybe 15-18'. I think the snow from two nights ago had been battered by the wind/consolidated some and this new snow that had loaded last night was failing on the density change. "

This snowmobile triggered slide occurred at approximately 1200 moments before we arrived. The crown depth ranged from 2 feet to 6 feet where it was wind loaded near the cornices. On the edges of the flank below the ridge a little bit, snowpack depth was 3.2 feet which is very shallow. This path likely ran in late December based on this shallow snowpack depth.

The rider had climbed through a clearing in the trees to the lookers left of the path. Near the ridge top he sidehilled to the west in order to descend an open area. There were a few rocks poking through the snow (evidence of a thin snowpack) and he slowed down a bit. Then he saw the slope fracture. He instantly deployed his air bag back pack then turned down hill and tried to escape the avalanche.

He feathered/pumped the throttle attempting to get off the slab but it kept fracturing in front of him. About 1/3-1/2 way down the slope, he began rising up what felt like 10 feet in the air. He was afraid that his sled would then nose dive, so he hit the throttle to keep the nose of his sled up and maintain control of the sled. As he move further down slope with the avalanche, he was engulfed in the powder cloud and couldn't see anything. He pinned the throttle again and shot out of the powder cloud and ahead of the avalanche debris.

He and his two partners all carried avalanche rescue gear (avalanche beacons, shovels, probes and air bag back packs). His partners were in a safe location when the avalanche occurred. They had attended a recent avalanche awareness talk given by the Utah Avalanche Center forecaster assigned to this zone. Additionally they had read the advisory for the day and remembered the danger being mostly LOW with a few areas that included slopes like this one as being MODERATE.

Air bag comments: It is remarkable that this rider was able to inflate his air bag AND maintain control of his sled to escape the avalanche. Many other riders have time to do one or the other. Additionally he was wearing the type of air bag that inflates around the head, neck and shoulders (presumably to prevent trauma to the head and neck). He reported that his focus was down hill in front of the sled, and the air bag did not in any way block his vision.

It was actively snowing with some wind loading. First skiers performed a ski cut at the top of two dogs and we saw no signs of instability at the time. The first skier skied the slope without incident. The second skier skied the same slope, but mid slope where the pitch starts to level off slightly a small pocket released and ran a short distance. The skier was able to ski away without incident. We inspected the slide from the bottom so measurements are only guesses. It looked to be a crown of 8-10"" with a width of 30"" and ran a short distance of 10 feet or so. After considering what could have been the cause since it released mid slope where the angle started to mellow out slightly we thought it could have been a grauple pocket that could have collected in that area forming a small isolated weak area.

A small, short sweet slope with a wider, less steep slope to skiers left.  It looked delectable and I center punched it.  Two turns in I saw the cracks form and most of it let loose.  It was somewhat similar to a big sluff, but it had a crown and it was a slab.  I took a short ride.  I tried to ski off to the side and missed the brunt, but I discovered it is difficult to ski to the side when the slope is moving downhill.  I ended up mostly covered with snow, but I wouldn't say I was buried.  I did lose my prescription sunglasses and was very lucky and grateful to find them. 

I did not measure the slope angle so 40 degrees is an estimate.  I did not inspect the bed surface, although I am reasonably confident is was the new snow-old snow interface.  The 5 turns I made at the bottom of the little avalanche were soft, and creamy.  Slabs are difficult to identify.

We had previously skied a NE facing aspect of Upper Days.  Skied a WSW aspect of upper days afterwards.  Went up a questionable skin track up the Days headwall to exit.  Saw no signs of instability and the snow didn't feel slabby to me.  Face shots were not abundant but did occur.  

As I watched people ski the days headwall, which had more snow, I wondered how different the conditions were on those aspects compared to what slid on me.  I think not much.  A couple of degrees in steepness and few degrees in aspect.  The skiing was fabulous and will be better tomorrow.  I think most of us tease the dragon more than we know.  "

After a great run on Bonkers we continued up the skin track into the upper reaches of Broads Fork.  My partner and myself had mentioned the possibility of a glide avalanche coming down off of blue ice and the diving board and agreed that spacing would be important on the skin across the bottom. A group of skiers who had ascended earlier in the day were heading down as we were heading up the skin track and they skied the slope bellow blue ice quickly as well. After crossing the tree patch and continuing on to the roll over that constitutes the upper basin of Broads Fork I looked back and saw that a glide avalanche had broken loose and covered the skin track and the skier tracks under blue ice. I was able to see large blocks still tumbling and the debris settling into the slope we had just crossed. This is one of those experiences that has been best described as we got away with one. Though glide avalanches may be harder to predict, rapid warming on steep smooth rock and the time of day should have played more of a factor in the decision making. Both my partner and I consider ourselves fortunate to be able to sit here and drink a beer while writing this report today. We get to take a pebble from the luck jar and put it in the experience jar. I hope the other party of skiers descending shortly before the slide can look at it the same way if they even saw the slide. There were 8 parties including ours in Broads today that we saw, glad that everyone lucked out and that no one was caught in this slide. We obviously did not go and check out the slide, but did snap some quick pictures before heading out.  You can see the slide covering 5 different ski tracks and the skin track.

Forecaster comments:

Avalanche was almost identical to the accident that occurred there on March 9, right down to the weather conditions prior. On Tuesday, March 22, the mountains received 6-10"" of new snow accompanied by moderate winds that shifted from SW to NW. The new snow drifted into the gully on top of the bed surface/remaining facets from the slide of March 9. Two skiers descended the upper slopes without incident and regrouped at the top of the steep convexity. Apparently opting not to descend into the gully, tracks indicate that they made a ski cut across the top releasing the pocket at a slightly higher elevation than the earlier slide. Second skier then followed across and they descended a lower angle, tree covered slope. 

This avalanche path has been very active this season, releasing twice naturally. On December 26, it fractured 6-7' deep and ran full track, or approximately 3000' taking out small trees going up the bank on the far side, and rounding the corner into the main drainage of Gold Basin.

PI rates were pushing 2 in/hr for the preceding two hours prior to our descent.  

On my second ski cut I triggered a storm slab that propagated 10-15 ft uphill (about halfway between the ridge and I), and about 300 ft laterally.  The avalanche ran 500-600 ft. to the beginning of the ""half pipe"" portion of the Main Days slide path.

Most likely attributable to the awesomely high PI rates out there today and possibly some very minor wind loading on northerly aspects.  Served as a good reminder to stay assertive while dealing with new snow instability. 

We checked in with the two other parties skiing from the top of Main Days before exiting to BCC.  Only small point releases and a few roller balls noted lower in the drainage.

Snow conditions changed surprisingly quickly from dry and light around noon, to slightly damp and crumbly with a few, small roller balls on the first lap, to moderately cohesive with rollerballs running and growing on the second, to big naturals on the third. 

Under the storm snow on the west aspect there was a slightly noticeable crust on the upper third of the slope -- measuring from the ridge to the summer trail -- also a thin, but consistently noticeable crust in the middle third, and a firm crust in the bottom third. Apparently it rained in LCC on Monday. Maybe this was that or a melt/freeze crust? 

FIrst lap was all good. Great turns up top with stable snow. Middle third we cut above a few gullies, and it ran, but didn't gather or pull in other adjacent snow. We traversed out right to a skinner in sight from there and re-ascended. 

Second lap was more similar than different in the upper two thirds, although the snow had gotten thick, like ice cream. The bottom third was sketchy. Our cuts here flushed the snow we expected, but pulled in adjacent snow along the funnel-like terrain features. Shooting cracks occurred left, right and in some instances above where the cuts were made. Due to the thicker crust towards the bottom of the slope, all that snow picked up a bunch of energy and ran fast and far. The three in our group descended one at a time from tree to tree, or along the bed surface of a slide path until we were out of that zone. 

We bailed part way up the skinner for a third run over in Scotties Bowl, because we came across multiple slides, some completely natural with no tracks in sight, some big and wide debris piles, and we had no way to know if another party was above us to potentially bring a slide down on top of us. 

Danger seemed mainly Considerable with pockets of High, particularly at lower elevations where there was a pronounced crust and later in the afternoon when the storm snow had begun to bond. We even got lots of cracks and slabs of storm snow to flush through the trees in the runout above the bridge at around 8500 feet. 

Today was a day to expect some danger, pay attention for it, and make conservative decisions. We hope that everyone who went out in the backcountry today came back.

Both crowns zig-zagged from small tree to small tree and the larger one was at probably 300' or more feet wide. Neither ran more than 100'. We didn't go investigate, so just observed from a another part of the bowl, but they looked to be fairly solid slabs, not just the soft storm chunks I've seen sloughing off the last two days. 

We also encountered two other smaller slides. One was on the east ridge of the same bowl and appeared to have broken all the way up on the ridgeline; it ran all the way into the bowl (3-400'?). The other was visible on a similar aspect ridge further west, also running down the west side of the ridge into a larger slide path.

I've skied a lot of north and east facing terrain over the last three days and been up on a number of normally wind-affected ridgelines and found no evidence of slabbing or instability, so this was a bit surprising to me. I think the east (southeast?) winds at the beginning of the storm crossloaded these sub-ridges and the gut of the bowl below Cougar setting up wind slabs that looked like they must've run sometime within the last two days.

Things are settling out, I'm sure, but good to be cautious out there right now. Not much instability but it may be hard to detect or in places you wouldn't expect it."

The crusty bed surface was challenging to ski.  Most of the crowns were about 6"", but one crown pulled out about a foot deep on the side of the chute further down.  The debris on the apron skied well.

It gouged into the old snow but did not step down. The slide moved slowly and ran out after 100-150 vertical. No one was caught, no one was below.

We decided to do another ski cut, and we triggered a 6"" - 1' deep - 60' wide slide that ran down the elevator chute. Below the chute, it stepped into another layer and caused a good portion of the bowl to slide.

But, I skied a moderately steep East facing slope on a very warm day (45 degrees reported by NWS Top of Collins station at similar altitude and time of my accident), in mid afternoon, knowing there was a several inches deep new snowpack from last week's storm on top on the old consolidated base.

Went up to Alta today to take a look at Main Chute on Baldy. I've had good early season success skiing that there, so we skinned up to the top of Collins to scout it, and thinking it looked relatively filled in, decided to climb up to the top of Mt. Baldy for Main Chute via Sugarloaf Pass. At the top, there was obvious wind loading on the line, but the pillow of wind loaded snow looked relatively shallow, isolated and manageable. We did not see any other tracks around the area leading to the chute or apron, so I decided to drop in and do a ski cut. A soft storm/light wind slab pulled out at my feet ripping across the length of the chute 8 to 10 inches deep. It continued down the length of the line, propagating along the width of the chute on its way down. It started slowly, and looked like it would stop, so I was surprised to see it pick up steam on the way down. I knew there had been some wind loading, but I thought the ski cut would result in a more isolated pocket pulling out. The snowpack had a bit of an upside down feeling to it. We continued down the chute, and for the first few turns, the bed surface was consolated snow that was skiable. Then, halfway down, the bed surface became more sugary, unconsoladated snow and quite rocky. Perhaps we were overly optimistic about the amount and density of new snow in the Wasatch when we decided to drop into Main Chute this morning, but I felt able to manage the ski cut and the risk appropriately. It's always a good reminder to ensure that there is no one below you when you do a ski cut at a heavily trafficed area (we were certain that there was no one in the line when we dropped in, but Main Chute has a blind turn in the middle, so we couldn't see the apron and runout zone.) Also, a small avalanche has big consequences this time of year, with the capacity to cheese grater you over some sharky rocks, so take care. I suspect this wind slab/new storm snow will stabilize within 24 to 48 hours, but on the upper elevation north facing terrain, the old snow will continue to be a problem for awhile.

 Going in, our main questions were: 
•	What layer did the snow fail on?  Was the storm snow failing on a weakness within, at the interface with thanksgiving snow, on leftover facets, or gliding on the rock itself?
•	Was this spot representative of high north aspects generally, or something special? 
The crown of the avalanche ranged in depth from as shallow as a foot (it was roughly that where the  skier tracks enter) to over 2' feet deep.  At the top of the slide and just above, the slope approaches 45 degrees.  And very much as Kliger described, the slide exposed rock below the snowpack—broad enough that it was hard to keep an edge on with skis and not worth trying in boots.  Perhaps more dramatic than the slide were the series of 2’ deep cracks on either side of the flanks.
Inspection of the flank and crown revealed 5-9mm facets at the base of an otherwise right-side-up snowpack.  The facets were sharp and dry, and failed on the 9th tap from the wrist on an ECT done in 50cm.  
Extended column tests performed to the west of the crown and just below the toe had similar profiles but important differences: Both were deeper (70cm), the facets were smaller (3-5cm) and we only got propagation along the facets with some heavy hitting “bonus” whacks at the end of the test.  
The absence of strong signs of instability so near to the avalanche, combined with tantalizing evidence of consequence-free steep skiing nearby, seems to support the forecast’s assessment that high elevation North aspect persistent slab problems are decidedly present, but perhaps trending from localized to isolated areas.

There were occasional brief gusts of wind coming across the ridge line above us, with just a few inches of very light new snow on the rock band at the very top, on Peak 9981. As we approached our top out point near the bottom of the rock band, a very small sluff came down the 60 to 70 degree rock band. It slowly propagated the new snow below the rock band, on the old bed surface. It caught and slowly carried one member of our party, on top of about 18"" of moving snow, for about 300 vertical feet down the slope. He was not injured or partially buried, and merely stood up once he stopped. Fortunately we had been careful to travel spread out, and to avoid traveling above hazards that we could have been carried into. Just like the forecast said ""low hazard doesn't mean no hazard"".

From my vantage point I sighted the slope at the crown around 40 degrees. I can generally sight within 2 degrees so it is safe to say the slope at the crown is between 38 and 42 degrees. The suspected weak layer is facets. The snowpack here is shallow and rocky and is a very likely spot to find faceted snow. The slope also appears to have been cross loaded. So you have windslab sitting on the weak facets and it failed under the weight of the skier. The slide ran maybe 600 feet and 150 feet wide.

I skied second and skier's right of his track and remotely triggered the second pocket that broke higher and ran further out onto the face.

The slope is north facing, I was not able to get a slope angle at the crown, but it broke at about the steepest part of the rollover. I measured 19 inches deep at the part of the crown I was able to get to, it looked deeper a little further out on the slope, maybe 24 inches at most. The slab consisted of the new snow that began falling Thursday afternoon. In the photos below you can clearly see two layers of snow comprising the slab. The bottom layer is the snow that fell Thursday into Friday morning and the top layer is the snow that started late Friday into today. Top layer is Fist density and the bottom layer is Fist Plus or maybe Four Finger Minus. This is a good example of how low density snow can still form a slab. The weak layer was a layer of Graupel between the bottom layer of the slab and the Bed Surface. There was a lot of graupel with the snow that fell Thursday into Friday. The bed surface was a thin crust that was very easy to break through. After our last storm the winds shifted and blew out of the NE, and I believe these winds are responsible for the thin crust that served as the bed surface. In my report yesterday I noted sensitive snow on this face as we walked the ridge line and experienced collapsing with loud whoomphs. We remotely triggered another part of the slope higher up the ridge on our second lap. As you are about to top out on the peak there is an island of trees on the ridge maybe 50 feet down off the peak.

I was not wearing ski gear when I drove by, but I did wallow up to my waist in sneakers to the toe to measure the slope angle. It was right at 30 degrees. It is a small slide, but one that I think is very interesting. You could see egg shell cracking for at least 100' on either side of the avalanche. And two pockets released together. Both of these things indicate how sensitive things are and the ability for the fracture to propagate. The very low slope angle is also interesting and rare, at least for the Wasatch. I'm nearly certain it slid on large surface hoar. I wasn't able to wallow any further to check for sure, but there was a distinct dark colored, facet-looking layer just above the bed surface all around the flanks and crown (see close up photo).  This is a big red flag to me, especially for lower elevation terrain traps.

The party of 2 at the saddle had seen it slide.  They said they thought it was naturally triggered. However, another party was above the slide skinning up (on the south side of Little Superior), and I suspect that it could have also been remotely triggered by them.  The winds were blowing about 20 to 30 m/h from the NNW onto the SE facing slope.  Winds were not very prevalent in most areas and were mostly confined to this area and summits.  The crown was about 18"" to 24"" deep.  It ran with several slabs of snow remaining on the slope, but also entrained snow.  Near the bottom of our descent on Two Trees, we observed a fresh debris pile that covered the tracks from yesterday.  We expect that it ran about 1300 vertical feet or more.  Time was a concern for my party so we did not investigate the slide further (hardness of the slab is an estimate). 

The party that (may have) triggered the slide, were not caught and traversed SW across the south side of Little Superior.  We observed their tracks down the south facing nose of Little Superior.  The wind affected snow seemed very pockety and there were many absolutely tremendous options to ski down that were much safer.

The avalanche failed on a thin layer of faceted snow above a crust that formed on January 18th when we had a warming trend along with high pressure. A series of storms came across northern Utah on the 20th and lasted until the 26th of January. The mountains along the Park City ridge line received roughly 45"" inches of new snow with 3"" inches of water over the course of six days. This avalanche was triggered the first sunny day after a storm and the avalanche danger was rated considerable for that aspect and elevation.

 

Comments by witness party:  Our party of four were doing laps in the Home Run cirque, and on the way home via the Sound Of Music, discovered a fresh and large slide path with obvious crown and large debris pile far below in the aspens. Below the side path a short distance was the party of 3 or 4 who were milling around doing nothing, so we assumed it was them that triggered it and no one was hurt or in need of assistance. This slide was directly off the skiiers right side of the SOM, which typically gets a sun crust between stoms, and is very steep. Photos below are...1.) Slide Crown shots wrapping around the SOM shoulder. 2.) Debris pile 3.) SOM face with the involved groups' tracks on skiers right shoulder.

N, S, and E winds were observed all within seconds of each other.  Crossloaded steep terrain features of Silver Creek Peak were prime concern and proved to be reactive to ski cuts.  Two consecutive pockets pulled out in steep chutes on the east face.  Both fanned out quickly but had marked wind slab characteristics of uneven crown depths up to 12"" deep x 80' wide x 200' vertical.  Although the sun was out all day, the temps remained cold in the wind zone and never felt too warm out of the gale.  Many different user groups out and about today and so it is no wonder that the obs list includes multiple human and natural triggered avalanches being observed.  I believe the continued winds tonight and into tomorrow will make these wind slabs much less manageable and a considerable danger exists around the compass above 9500'.  This problem coupled with the persistent slab issues of NSF/SH make for a complex snowpack.  Sheltered terrain is harder to find with the NNE winds and with sunny skies people will be crawling all over looking for fresh, skiable lines.

The other  ECTP19 Q3 down 35 on those NSF that this avalanche occurred on. 

Strength- Moderate Took a fair bit of force but definitely not strong. 

Structure- BAD...Lots of lemons.  Weak layer depth was less than a meter, hardness difference of more than one step, facets as the weak layer,  grain size difference and a weak layer thickness of less than 10cm. 

Energy- High to Moderate Q1 ECT score with a sudden planar failure and a Q3 in another location of the crown.

The first occurred around 12:30pm and was called in by a maintenance worker. It covered both lanes with 3-5' of debris. The highway was immediately closed and northbound traffic was turned around while remaining southbound vehicles were ushered through once the plow cleared a single lane. The avalanche was a wet, loose avalanche likely triggered by a sudden spike in rain intensity as the rain/snow line ascended in elevation. The snowpack in that path was roughly 70-90 cm so the rain percolated through to the ground quickly. The avalanche ran only about 150' vertical. 

A second avalanche just to the south of the first occurred at approximately 1pm and also covered both lanes of the highway though not as deeply, 1-3 feet. It too only ran about 150' vertical. One remaining public vehicle was able to drive through the deposition of the second though only with 4wd. It was decided then to not allow UDOT workers into the area to clear due to the continuing danger.

A third avalanche hit the road  at about 1:30pm landing in between the first two. This one ran about 300' vertical with a much higher starting point in the path. It appears to have been triggered by strong winds and subsequent roller balls. It widened out to about 40' and entrained more snow on the way down. It too covered both lanes of the highway. (see video below of third - poor quality)

No other significant avalanche activity was noted in the canyon during that time though there were signs of instability like roller balls everywhere.

Right after I skied down there were multiple slides all over Clayton Peak triggered by skiers and snowboarders. The snow must have hit the proper temperature to start sliding right as we got there. Glad to be alright and, as always, the mountains demand respect!

Other snow structure tests in the vicinity indicate the graupel layer from the first part of the latest event was having problems bonding to the slick old snow surface. Note, the other smaller slab that released just to the right of the main slab, and it was directly under the rocks. Also of note, graupel pooling may have also contributed to the reactivity of this slab/weak layer interface. And finally, this slab most likely was also thickened, and created by the NW winds that were active during the storm event on Saturday evening.

We'd skied two laps on Corn Bowl and felt confident on our route back to the resort, having skied it several times in what felt like increasingly stable conditions over the past several days.  

On this run I skied a slightly steeper section  of clean looking snow (no wheels or debris) down toward the cat road leading back to Redpine.  On the first turn I saw debris start dropping from the ridge, but not in an alarming way.  On the second turn I saw more snow moving and then the slope fractured remotely about 40' downslope from me.  The fracture instantly reached 100' wide and the slope between it and me broke apart into heavy chunks.  Simultaneously the slab fractured 40' above me with an 18"" crown and that snow came down on me, knocking me over.  It was clear the entire slope was moving toward some nasty trees very quickly.  I pulled my airbag as the force of the upper snow hit my legs and knocked me over.  The slide carried me approximately 125' and I stopped just short of a grove of aspens, shaken and without some gear but otherwise fine.  

We'd skied this slope many times this week and I think given the warm temps and general relaxed spring mood I took my mind off the slope angle for a moment and that was all it took.  "

The fracture line was several hundred feet wide (and wider than ""typical"" slides in that chute). I was carried several hundred feet and able to get myself out of the deposition zone. Was skiing solo. I had skied the area yesterday and the snow was wet and there appeared to be good bonding with the underlying snow pack. I had climbed up Mt. Millicent for access and there was an approximately 20 mph wind from the west and heavy slab deposits on the east fact of Milly. I watched a group test and ski cut the East Face and of Milly and release some large runs and decided against skiing that aspect.

I complete several ski cuts at the entrance (not much powder, solid pack) and approximately 30 feet into stupid chute (decent bonding with new snow, no noticeable wind slab).

At the first little steep pitch below the rocky rollover we were chatting, heads down following the skin track. All of a sudden we heard yelling to watch out and a lone skier had triggered a small, soft wind slab on to us. There was not that much snow, but it was enough to knock my partner of balance and he was pulled 30 ft down hill and both skis were pulled off (his toes were both locked). We spent the next 30 minutes searching for his lost ski. Everyone was okay and we proceeded to cautiously ski a few runs of awesome powder. We continued to experience lost of cracking, but managed terrain, kept our slope angle low, and stayed off wind loaded slopes. 

Lessons and takeaways:
1) I have seen this slope avalanche many times. If i am setting the skinner I keep it tight to the trees and make 35 switchbacks instead of 1 out on to the slope. I know this, but I was being lazy and following what was already there. NOTE TO SELF: ""don't be lazy! set the correct skin track and always assume nobody knows what they are doing.""
2) The mountains could care less that humans call it spring and UAC has stopped issuing advisories. Avalanches can and will happen when it snows.
3) The lone skier was being attentive and was actually trying to avoid the skin track and got turned around and ended up right on top of us. While he could have picked a safer line, it is our responsibility to avoid being on and under dangerous slopes. The chances that the slope could have gone naturally today are actually pretty good. We should have been paying more attention and reset the skin track in a better place. "

So we decided to head to the Crows Feet, and sought out a lower angle ascent route to take us from Bells to the South Fork of Dry Creek. As we neared the ridge the slope angle increased and the terrain grew rocky, and by the time we were within a switchback of the ridge we were gapping out as far as we could on the slope. While I waited in a corner beneath the ridge, my partner made one final switchback toward a break in the rocks. When he was 30 feet away, a soft slab broke out just above him, and carried him a short distance downhill. However, the slab propagated quickly into the corner in which I stood, and carried me about 150-200 feet down the slope, at which point I managed to grab a tree. No injury or burial, fortunately. We skinned back up the bed surface and examined the crown line, which was about 12"" deep, and appeared to be wind deposits from Friday night's NW winds that failed on graupel.

We encountered similar pockets of wind slab failing on graupel on north-facing aspects in the Crows Feet, though these were much more manageable.

We had two significant storms in late December - one on the 23rd and the other on the 25th that added additional weight to the slope. Wind on the night of the 27th likely caused additional loading to the slope - which was too weak to support the additional snow. The faceted snow (weak layer) was formed by dry and cold periods of weather in October, November, and December.

We all look over the other side of ridges and rarely do we trigger avalanches. Please be especially careful this season with such an unstable snowpack. The Solitude Ski Patrol will be working in this area on Saturday, December 30th.

On our way from Twin Lakes Pass to the Emma's Ridge and Sliver Fork, I went to look into Solitude's Honeycomb Canyon at the saddle about where the Alta snowcat typically turns around.  This is probably something I've done many times just to check out the view.

Knowing there are large cornices along this ridgeline, I walked to a spot to the right of the saddle where I could see dirt and rocks and would not stand on the cornice.  On my way back to the saddle, perhaps as I moved from the more rocky area to a marginally thicker snowpack, the cornice broke about 5 feet from me.  The lip of the cornice was perhaps 8 feet from me.  As is typically the case, this broke bit farther back than I expected.  This cornice was quite large and caused a good sized avalanche below.  

West/southwest winds have been blowing the last two days and prior to the cornice breaking you could see new growth on the cornice.  Perhaps this made it more sensitive. 

Immediately after the cornice broke, I called Solitude Dispatch to let them know nobody was caught.  This avoided Solitude sending patrollers to look for anyone who may have been caught.  Honeycomb Canyon was closed at the time so there were no skiers below.

The first skier entered the slope and triggered the slide on his second turn. It broke approximately 5 to 10 feet above him and around 100 feet wide. He immediately tried to cut right but was caught and carried through the smaller aspen trees.

	The rescue and the response to this avalanche happened incredibly fast. It was 2 hours from the time the avalanche happened until Skier 2 was delivered to an ambulance. He sat in the snow for 2 hours getting colder by the minute. ALWAYS BE PREPARED BECAUSE IT COULD TAKE MUCH LONGER if you don't have reception for your cell phone, if a helicopter is not immediately available, if there is not a good landing zone nearby (the helicopter landed right next to this skier), if there is bad weather or darkness, or any other number of reasons that complicate rescue.
	This group has a huge amount of experience skiing in the backcountry, well over 60 years. It's very tricky to accurately assess stability.
	This was their 6th run in the area. Don't trust the snowpack we have this year because there are a lot of booby traps out there.
	With persistent slab avalanches and remotely triggered slides, runout zones include terrain beneath adjacent slide paths. 
	DON'T STAND IN RUNOUT ZONES.

This avalanche happened sometime in the afternoon, we observed afterward from the next sub-drainage and went to look from the Davis Gulch northern ridge.  We saw no tracks on the slope above nor the runout but did see a smaller storm slab a few hundred feet above with soft debris running the gut of Davis Gulch and triggering the larger ~2-4 ft. crown that propagated on this midslope rollover.   My assumption is that a skier in the Gobbler's north ridge area today ran a small sluff that popped the upper slab and subsequently the debris weight propagated the lower into the gulch terrain trap below.  

We were unable to safely approach the bed surface to look at the crown but think that the NSF/graupel layer from the Feb. 4th interface may be the bed surface, like the recent West Monitor slide (despite the aspect difference).  

The new water weight seems to be finding some sleeping dragons, hopefully no one was affected by this one.

Remotely triggered, though just barely - 5 to 10' away.  There were probably a dozen tracks off the shoulder into Mill A basin prior to the avalanche.  Avalanche looks similar to the Toots to Boot avalanche from Monday with similar layering/history though accounting for aspect.  

Weakness was 2cm of .5-1mm rounding but loose facets sandwiched between two mf crusts.  Third photo has the red line along this weakness. Only two of six ECT tests elicited full propagation in the moderate and hard category.  No collapsing or cracking noted.

Overall height of snow was roughly 115cm with various crusts and plenty of very weak facets and depth hoar.  Could be an interesting wet avalanche cycle this spring.

This avalanche was initiated by a single hand charge on Thursday March 8th, 2018. The route members tossed several shots onto a hanging snowfield on the eastern flanks of Silver Creek Peak without results. At approximately 8:30, the 2nd or 3rd shot placed in the area initiated a 2'x150' avalanche failing on the weak snow near the ground. The slide cascaded over the 80' to 100' cliff band and crashed onto the open bowl below. Slope angle was measured at this point. Upper field was likely closer to 32 degrees steepness. The resulting avalanche propagated over 1500' wide and stepped down from the initial faceted layer 140cm deep into basal facets as it reached numerous rock fingers lower in the bowl. The 1F hard slab broke apart and piled up on several of the benches below, and was eventually channeled into the gully systems below. Old tracks from former skiing parties in the lower drainage were obliterated and the debris piles were over 4 meters deep in places. The toe of the debris came to rest nearly 1750' below the placement of the explosive. The crown below the rock band averaged 150cm to 180cm, with its deepest point reaching 275cm. The 2/18 dirt layer is clearly visible throughout the crown and flanks, and even in the chucks of debris that were not pulverized.

This slide released on a layer of facets about 3-4 inches beneath an obvious layer of dust. The dust is not a factor but just a good marker and a good way to find the location of these facets. See stripe of dust in the third photo below.

Locals who've been riding in this zone all winter have been avoiding similar terrain on bigger slopes. This slide is demonstrates the wisdom of that choice. Bigger north facing terrain near rock bands will likely produce bigger avalanches. Rocky areas tend to have weaker and more faceted snow. They also have lots of good trigger points.

My partner and I left Alta around 1 PM for a short tour for exercise and a quick snowpack eval.  Graupel was falling, accumulating anywhere from 0 to perhaps 8 cm deep, with variations due to wind transport.  A stout, 1 cm, rain crust existed above about 9200 feet that was extremely slick.  We skinned up low-angle terrain beneath Toledo Bowl. 

At about 9500 feet (thumbnail F above), we decided not to go higher into steeper terrain and to return to Alta.  As my partner descended the slope just to skiers left (east) of the pucker trees, a slough broke out on a slope that we measured later at 20 degrees.  The slough continued down slope and I shouted to my partner who skied right into the pucker trees as the slough continued its slow march downslope, eventually descending into Toledo Gully.

We continued slowly working our way downhill, encountering a solo skier who eventually skied ahead of us and encountered a debris pile where Toledo Gully crosses the jeep road and traditional skin track to Cardiff Pass.  The solo skier told us he witnessed no other skiers in the vicinity, but he skied ahead of us and wisely did a beacon search where there was a debris pile at the skin/track jeep trail, finding no signals.  We then caught up to him, had a quick discussion, and the solo skier went down perhaps 100 vertical feet further to the toe and did another search, again finding no signals.  My partner and I repeated both searches just to be sure, then returned to Alta and reported the slide to UDOT.

Photos below illustrate the remarkably low angle nature of the starting zone of this slide and how it ultimately descended into and down Toledo Gulch.  My partner is near the toe of the slide in the final photo, with a debris pile more than deep enough to bury someone.  A stout rain crust served as an extremely slick bed will likely be a problem tomorrow as well.  Typical practice of keeping slope angles under 30 degrees may not be sufficient in areas where this graupel on rain crust exists."

The slide ran about 450 feet. It looked like it may have been triggered as a secondary slide because there was another smaller crown above a cliff band directly above the crown.

Sluffs were traveling fast and far and entraining a lot of snow.  Fun and amusing until one caught my feet, very nearly carried me over a steep rollover, and ran fast for several hundred vertical feet past me. Partnership management became an issue because getting hit from above was a real threat. The bed surface was hard, shiny ice and sliding for life was a secondary threat. Riding conditions were actually fast and fun on slopes less than about 10 deg in steepness but everything else was hard and slick but at least smooth. I'd call the danger considerable and very unlike anything we normally see.  High likelihood (virtual certainty) with low consequences that could quickly get out of hand on a long open steep slope with terrain hazards.  Snowing hard when we left.

Party of two was ascending terrain adjacent to Blue Ice run in Broads Fork of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Partner A was 60-70' above Partner B as they recognized fresh wind-loading and decided to spread out on the skin track. Partner A triggered the wind slab, and went for the full ride of the avalanche - an estimated 300'. Partner A had lost their skis, and was partially buried, having to use their shovel to extricate themselves from the debris. Partner A then walked up the debris searching for Partner B. At an estimated 100' below the crown of the avalanche (200' above where Partner A began their search), Partner A found Partner B's ski which was still attached to Partner B. At the time Partner B was unconscious and was partially buried. Partner A was able to isolate an airway and determined partner B was breathing, but still unconscious. Partner B was unconscious for an estimated 30 minutes, before they regained consciousness. Partner A and B then began a self rescue back to the Broads Fork trailhead, with the assistance of a party on an adjacent slope. Despite not having Partner A's skis for travel, the team made it back to the trailhead and to the emergency room at the hospital.

Fortunately, this accident had a much better outcome than what could have happened. Partner A and B's ability to self-rescue, given the loss of gear and long period of being unconscious, is remarkable. Thank you for sharing this information with the Utah Avalanche Center.

A very experienced avy forecasting team remotely triggered the avalanche in the images above while descending a lower angle, adjacent slope. Breaking 2'-4' deep and 400' wide, this slide was initiated from a distance, on an upper elevation southeast facing slope, broke to weak snow near the ground, and stacked up a tremendous amount of debris in the gully of the runout.

 

Now here's the curious as well as the spooky thing about this incident.... this is the 6th notable slide triggered on a southeast aspect which is quite unusual given the fact that we generally steer towards the sunny terrain when we're dealing with persistent weaknesses in the snowpack. However, a common theme we're seeing is this... nearly every big slide triggered since the New Years snow and wind event has had an easterly component to its aspect.

 

Given this setup I'm watching my top knot :)

The avalanche was roughly 200' wide and 6"" deep.  It was triggered on a small sub ridge to skiers right that was cross loaded due to the northwest winds this am.  The width was more lateral rather that horizontally wide.  Meaning it propagated along the subridge to the skiers right more than across the chute.

 

Couple learning objectives: 

 

1. Skiing off the moving slab of snow was a good move on the skiers part. 

2. The members in his party were out of the way of the avalanche below him.

3. Leap frogging down the chute going from safe point to safe point was key.

4. Always keeping islands of safety in sight and using them in confined gullies like this.

Before teaching Brighton Backcountry 101 this afternoon, I decided to do a bit of class prep and look around to see what's going on in the Brighton Basin. Fresh snow and sustained southwest winds steered me towards a cross-loaded slope to confirm suspicions. Standing on a lower angle portion of the slope (island of safety) I took off my skins, shifted my weight slightly, slid a ski tip into a fat portion of the drift in front of me and was able to trigger this fresh drift that was surprisingly tender and connected. Avy failed on a preserved layer of near surface facets.

FORECASTER NOTE:  If you are riding in avalanche terrain, it is wise to put only one person on a steep slope at a time so that if they trigger an avalanche, only one person is caught.  If you are caught and buried by an avalanche like this one, your best chance for your partners finding you is if you are wearing an avalanche beacon.  Also, this is the type of terrain where an airbag backpack may be beneficial in keeping you from being buried:


	It has a wide runnout zone where the debris can fan out instead of being funneled into a gully 
	It is clear of trees, rocks and cliffs.

Family in town for the weekend... I dropped them off at Brighton, hopped on Milly, and checked in with the local avalanche experts... AKA Brighton Ski Patrol :)

The crew informed me of a connected piece of snow in the backbowl that was worth looking at. I found a freshly triggered soft slab, low on the slope where grauple tends to pool. Averaging 12"" deep and about 75' wide there was just enough 4 finger hardness (yesterday's storm snow that got greenhoused and consolidated), allowing the slab to connect a bit wider than you might expect. Maybe big enough to knock you off your feet, but more of a wake up call is the need to manage all components of a steep descent, especially after you've nailed a big rad shot and have a low angle apron to cruise out on.... said lower angle terrain where grauple pools from steep slopes above, just might be the sleeper slope that could potentially catch you off guard.

One thing I did note was that it failed on a very thin heat crust.  Given the aspect and the relatively high sun angle, it's likely that this slope had a ""radiational recrystalization"" crust form two weeks ago.  It is difficult to confirm this but it is the most likely reason there would be a heat crust on a northwest facing slope.

On Saturday the 30th around 1300 a single snowboarder in a group of 4 had a close call, when he exited our terrain via the James Peak ridge line and into uncontrolled backcountry terrain. This slide path is named ""Scrapies"" for its otherwise flat rocky outcrops and narrow chokes in 2 separate chutes. This slide path is a regular producer and typically runs a natural cycle with even small amounts of new snow and south west winds due to large fetch zones. Avalanche classes of R1-2 and D1-2 are regular and typical December-February, with R2-3 and D2-3 usually occurring late in the season with higher annual snow totals and bridging of rocky anchors. Spring time regularly brings high incidents melt freeze and wet loose activity and incidents like this.

This incident was classified as a SS-ARu-R2-D2-I; 30 cm crown, 250-300’ wide, running 1000-1250 vertical feet; the starting zone is skiers right of center @9200', E aspect, 45-degree slope. The snowboarder was carried approximately 600 vertical feet, over several large rock outcrops before being able to stand up and exit the path skier's right back into the area boundary. Fortunately, we were able to contact the triggering party soon after it was observed and confirmed that there were no injuries or burials.

Based upon our investigation on the right flank adjacent to the starting zone, we found that the avalanche comprised of new snow from storm #33 in the form of a well-connected slab. This slab which likely rode on a slick bed surface comprised of melt freeze forms, and a buried NSF layer. This layer was very small and difficult to identify in grain identification, but was very noticeable with a brush to the pit wall (it is possible that the layer was simply a density interface from the onset of storm #33). An Extended Column Test ECT was performed and initial movement in the slab was noted at tap #7-8 with the column failing on tap #14, it broke with a classic “Pop” & “Drop”. The deposition zone was nearly 1000’ long and ranged from 6” to 3’ deep at the toe, it should be noted that gouging and wet loose type debris were found in the deposition.

As we climbed, we commented on the east winds. We climbed from Alta to Pole Line Pass to Little Superior. From Little Superior, we traversed Cardiac Bowl to the base of Thundrestruck. The snow on the east aspects had been blown off the slopes leaving a firm, but edgable surface that skied well. After skiing Thunderstruck we traversed north to ski another line. We climbed the sub-ridge and commented on how there were some small wind slabs that had formed. There were only ~2"" deep and the snow was quite dense under these (it was difficult to sink a pole in). After descending the next wave of the storm moved in socking in Cardiac Bowl in a thick fog. We traversed towards Superior with the plan to ski the south face back to the road. We knew there had been an accident on the south aspect on Wednesday, but other than the small wind slabs from the prior climb, we had not seen any red flags on the north aspects. We ascended Cardiac Bowl with the plan to gain the ridge up the east chute. The snow was dense and supportable. We had not had any cracking or collapsing, and the east winds had not appeared to have loaded the mid-bowl. We were skinning about 20' apart from each other and when we were ~50' from the ridge, we felt the collapse as the slope broke 30' above us 8"" deep and propagated 150' wide. 30-40' below the crown, the slide stepped down to the next weak layer forming a smaller, secondary crown. The dense snow knocked both of us over and slowly carried us down with it. We attempted to self-arrest, but the bed surface was too soft for a whippet to stick. Both of us rode the slide down 400' before being able to arrest.

 

Curious to understand what happened and what clues we missed, we ascended the bed surface to evaluate both crowns. Our theory is that the lower bowl did not appear wind loaded since it was an open slope, but the higher slope had rock features that trapped more snow to cause additional loading.

 

A pole and a whippet were lost, the whippet was found during the ascent. 

 

From the ridge, the decision was made to boot/skin back out the ridge to Pole Line Pass as we felt the south aspect would most likely have a similar wind load and the bed surface could likely be a much harder sun layer/crust. We encountered another party of 3 on the ridge who were planning to ski that area. They were able to see the crown as they booted up the ridge and after talking with us, they also decided to retreat back down the ridge.

UAC staff was not able to access the crown face of the avalanche. We determined there was no safe way to approach the crown. In fact, the following day, Tuesday, Dec 17, a skier flying a speed wing triggered an avalanche on the same slope. This skier was able to use his wing to become airborne and avoid being caught in the slide. 


Based on avalanches triggered by the ski patrol within their boundaries on Sunday, we think this avalanche was a soft slab of new snow. There may have been some wind drifting of the new snow blowing north to south and depositing additional snow just under the rock band where the avalanche occurred. We don't know what weak layer caused this slide. It may have simply been a poor bond underneath the new snow that fell December 12th-14th. 

 

The photo below shows Tuesday's avalanche and obvious wind drifting of snow (photo - Park City Ski Patrol).



 

On Friday, December 12, an avalanche was spotted to the north. Because that crown had fully reloaded, we were not able to get a crown profile of that avalanche either.

Avalanche Danger

During the brunt of the storms on Friday and Saturday, the avalanche danger was rated as HIGH in this terrain which is East-facing above 9500 feet in elevation. On the day of the accident, the avalanche danger was rated as CONSIDERABLE for this terrain. Sunday's avalanche forecast is available HERE.

Our plan was to traverse from the low angle terrain over to the ridge line and follow the ridge to the exit. The traverse portion would expose us for a short time with lower consequence. We came to the first path a little too low, exposing us to more of the slope than we expected. When we got there, my partner asked if this was still a good idea. She said the slope seemed wind loaded, rather than skin back up the 250 ft and traverse over a small distance we decided to traverse the slope where we were, one at a time. When she was about 5 feet onto the slope, I told her she needed to point more down hill to get momentum. The second she did I heard a very loud crack (this was not a whumpf). The slope shattered about 150 feet above her. I could see the crown line propagate down slope about 5 feet in front of me and then run another 200ft down slope. I screamed GO GO GO! She pointed down hill and started pole planting to get off the slope as it shattered around her. Thankfully, she was able to ski off the slope. It was a close call riddled with classic heuristic traps. 

 

Here's what she had to say: 

 

I unintentionally triggered an avalanche.
Me, the wimpy, very cautious, low-risk person I am.
After a great day of skiing with seeing some signs of instability but being unable to produce any movement or slides. We had seen a small slide in an ENE aspect under a rock band on the way up to our final descent. Upon reaching the before-mentioned traverse, I was tired and ready to get home. The light was getting a little flat at that moment, but still as I came around the corner and saw some signs of definite wind loading I became instantly nervous. Knowing myself and how easily I tend to get spooked, I asked my partner if this was still a good idea. He had no concerns as this is a slope we have skied many times and we’ve never seen run (I know, heuristic traps all around). I decided, I must just be overreacting and chose to trust my partner’s observations and go for the traverse instead of making us both skin up and around the ridge line. My partner reminded me to go fast and not stop for any reason which I dually noted. As I started out onto the slope, he suggested I angle more downhilll to get more speed across the exposed terrain. As I pointed more downhill, I felt a slight whumpf and my partner screamed at me to go, go, go! I knew instantly from his tone that I must have triggered an avalanche and was in immediate danger. As I skied as fast as I could using my poles and all the gusto I could muster, I glanced over my left shoulder at the snow moving downhill toward me. I was lucky, I made it to the safe zone without being caught, carried, or even feeling the snow moving under me. My partner later informed me that as the slide ripped out it sounded like a gunshot and the snow under my skis was, in fact starting to move.

My takeaway is to listen to my gut and trust my instincts. I have a tendency to get nervous and choose to be overly cautious in most situations, especially in avalanche terrain. As such, I have learned to lean on the opinions and experience of others a bit too much, especially when touring with people I know so well and trust.

Also, side note: Hats off to the small group that stopped and checked on us from the safety of the ridge-line. We are all accepting risks by going in to the backcountry and it’s important that we all be aware and have each others’ backs.

Just wanted to add some photos and info about the slide in Boiler Bowl on Monday. I was part of the party that triggered the slide. We stayed up in the area on Sunday and night. We watched it snow all afternoon. and then headed it out right before sunset to check out what the wind was doing on the ridge on the northside of White pine canyon, East of Boiler.  The wind was nuking. 30 - 40 mph gusts. Lots of snow moving around.  We kicked some cornices on a test slope and it was very reactive, propagated nicely. The E - NE aspects were active. Once you got straight north, we could not get anything to move. But it was just the wind transported snow. A layer of about 3-4 inches. The wind howled all night where we were staying and blew in all our tracks overnight and quit about 5am. 
Monday morning we headed toward Boiler bowl and ran into the Amy and Eric making laps on Burner run. Exchanged observations, discussed conditions and were not planning on dropping into Boiler but wanted to check out what was happing. So we walked the ridge and kicked cornices and saw no reaction. Not even shooting cracks., which surprised us based off of what we saw the night before. We could also see small pockets that had ripped out during the storm in the east-facing aspect of the Boiler. 
We discussed the risks heavily and possible scenarios, and after a lot of discussion, it was decided the probability of triggering a windslab was considerable, the consequences and size of a slide were lower.  One member of our party decided he was willing to take that risk and picked a conservative line down. He ski cut the top to a tree island. Right across a wind slab. We saw no cracks or settling from his ski cut. He took a couple more turns hugging the tree island. On the second turn, right where the slope rolls over to the steepest pitch (37 degrees) the fracture shot out to the right about 100 feet and started to move. The skier was is a very favorable position and easily turned off the slab right below the tree island. The slide ran slow. Almost like a wet slide. The crown was about 12 inches at the tallest point. The majority of it was probably 8 inches. 
The skier traversed the debris which was still soft to the right side of the bowl and skinned back up to the ridge through the trees. See the pictures for the moments it fractured and the aftermath. 

I am feeling a little guilty about the process as we were presented with obvious red flags the night before and then sucked into the good looking slope with the sunshine and the lack of signs once we were standing on top. Especially because we have all skied that bowl a lot over the past 20 years and know what it is capable of. So maybe the familiarity with the area played a factor as well. I think the other idea that played a role was that if it slid, it would not be large. We were pretty confident that the wind slab was not deep and there was a very low risk of a bigger deep slab instability.  Either way, we definitely crossed a line and are lucky it ended up the way it did. Another day of lessons taught to us in the mountains.

See the photos for a sequence of the fracture. Photos are taken from the ridge above where we watched. You can see the fracture start to the right of the skier.

Small slab avalanche triggered from the top of a ridge line broke out about 15 feet wide and quickly sluffed down the mountain about 100' vertical before loosing energy.

We noticed that tracks from last week were still visible in the bowl today and decided the wind had not terribly effected the 6 inches of new snow.

First ski cut from the top released the top layer and ran on the old snow interface. Interesting that the powder right next to the sluff stayed put as the second rider dropped in. Slope is about 40 degrees.

No other avalanche activity noticed. The sun was out warming up south aspects quite a bit but not enough to make any run. Cougar tracks on top of cougar peak?

After skiing another adjacent N facing line in the vicinity, we decided to ski a sheltered N facing line into the NW drainage off the N Syncline Trail specifically to avoid direct solar warming. We observed no visible natural activity all day on similar steep terrain; however, we did experience warm snow glopping on skins in areas that had canopy greenhousing. 

 

At 2:30PM, the snow at the entrance to the line at 8330' was firm, supportable, and still frozen. After passing through a narrow choke in the cliffs one at a time, we entered the start of the continuous chute individually. We discovered that the line had already partially slid and found ourselves skiing on the firm bed surface and minor wet debris. Skier 1 skied to 7300' and pulled off to skier's left at the vegetation line and hailed Skier 2 on the radio to begin skiing down. Skier 2 skied to 7400' where they were knocked over from behind by a large moving wet slide and carried to 6600'. Skier 2 was able to stay on top of the dense moving snow for the entirety of the 800' slide. Skier 2 fortunately sustained only minor bumps and bruises, and lost one ski pole. Immediately after the slide, both skiers were able to communicate via radio and ski out the rest of the line together. 

 

We estimate that the slide ran for a total of 1500' and filled in the width of the chute with debris for the extent of the run. It is unclear where the start zone was located or whether or not this was a skier-triggered slide. The amount of snow in motion when skier 2 got carried was considerably greater than could have been started by ski sloughing. There were no cornices present at the top of the line. The average slope angle of the chute was in the mid-30s. While we did not observe any local natural activity, there were other wet slides reported at similar times, aspects, and elevations in LCC and Provo. 

 

In hindsight, we started skiing this line too late in the day, after first deciding to ski another line. Clouds, wind, and N aspects were insufficient to halt the warming trend at mid-elevations. Even though the start of the line was cold and windy, conditions were considerably warmer 1000' down - something we only realized once had begun skiing the line.

This slab was the result of a moderate-weight cornice test on the top of Squaretop and propagated the last 2 days' new snow (15""), ~100' wide, a solid D2 result running full track to the flats.

Greenhousing Saturday through Monday provided a 1F thermal crust as the bed surface and Monday afternoon's trace of low-density snow was the failure layer with a 4F-F wind-affected slab propagating ~45' on each side of the cornice impact. 

I found no Tuesday graupel in the trigger area of this slide, possibly due to steep/hard bed slope angle shedding it.  This slab along the flanks failed CTV (on isolation).

This slab was isolated in its location and reactive due to slope angle.  It was critical to read terrain conservatively in S and W wind-load areas today and important to find slopes in the low 30 degrees where skiing was unbelievable.

Third party info, but looks like this piece of wind-drifted snow broke to weak snow in steep, rocky, technical terrain.

Second - We moved to a less steep part and smaller part of the slope to descend. The snowpack had been consistently breaking near our skis during our descent of CSR. What surprised me in this case was the slab broke about 10-15 ft above me. It was very slow moving and easy to move off the slab.

 

What was different? There was very noticable difference between these elevations near the bottom of CSR and higher on the ridge. 


	The Cracking and collapsing was more subtle higher on the ridge. Lower on the ridge the cracking was much more obvious and the cracks were inches wide. 
	The reason was that the snowpack was thinner near the bottom of the ridge. Having a thinner snowpack created much bigger and striated facets (4-6mm), thus a much weaker layer of facets under the new snow.

S aspects in Toledo and Emmas have HS 30-40cm. Rocky. West aspects are stripped up high and rotten down low. NW through NE to E aspects are suspect especially as the slope angle approaches 35 degrees. Collapsing is still happening as this persistent weakness gets it's first real test. 

I triggered this small avalanche from a 30 degree slope that failed and released where the slope angle approached 35 degrees. NE aspect at 10,100'. A quick crown profile indicated two important things. (1) I was unable to isolate a column along its flanks even after the slope had collapsed, and failure was in the well documented December depth hoar, but (2) much weak snow still remained in the bed surface.

Forecaster note: UAC staff were on the ridge several days later and saw tracks that appeared to have triggered this slide remotely. What's interesting is the lower slide that appears to have occured sympathetically. Second photo was taken by us at the ridgetop where it was likely remotely triggered.

A local logging company plowing the Mill Hollow Road undercut the Mill Hollow slide path earlier this week, knocking the legs out from under the slope, and stacking up enough snow on the road to knock you off your feet.

REGARDLESS - This avalanche is a major heads up of things to come. 

 

As more snow falls, there will be more avalanches like this one. The difference is that more snowfall will create a thicker slab. A thicker slab means the avalnaches will run farther, faster and create deeper debris.

We traveled to Currant Creek today via Mill Hollow. Visibility was in and out all day and made for difficult travel at times, when it did part we continued traveling and found the most notable piece of activity from the day. We scoped this slide in from the Dueschene ridge and made great time late in the day to the site with the help of my partner Tyler's great technical route-finding in low tide conditions. Along the way we found a few other pieces of snow that moved around, they can be seen in the images included. 

 

This was the most evident piece of avalanche activity of the day that we came across. The avalanche, SS-ARu-R2-D2-O, failed on facets on top of a pencil--->ice bed surface that was found widespread throughout mid to upper elevations on NW through SE aspects. Although the largest of the day, all of the other avalanches we observed today were found on the NE through E aspects as well, shared similar snow structure, and were failing on a layer of either NSF about a 25cm down , or closer to the ground on rotten faceted snow from November.

First natural cycle of the season. After an extended dry spell, 12""-20"" of snow accompanied by mod-strong SW winds placed a significant load on a shallow and fragile snowpack. Did not get close enough to observe the crown but snowpits dug that day, and up to this point throughout the season, revealed a stratified and faceted snowpack, with the primary layer of concern being a weak layer of loose facets from early November storms sitting on top of a faceted, knife hard, melt-freeze layer formed in late October. We also observed a weak layer higher up in the snowpack that failed with a score of ECTP18, and this could also be the culprit, but due to widespread sensitivity and collapsing on the deeper, faceted layer above the crust at 35 cm, I'm inclined to believe that is the weak layer involved here. As the avalanche moved down the slope it released the gully walls as a separate slab further down. It also likely caused a sympathetic release of the avalanche visible at the lower, mid-left of the photo.

Cracking occured over a wide area but it actually ran in a much smaller area, through some trees and into another steep, narrow gully. The bed surface was a thin facet layer above a hard refrozen layer, perhaps 2 1/2 ft total snow depth ( I forgot to measure the total depth).

We dug a snowpit on a safe representative slope nearby and found a snowpack structure that has been seen widespread across the Park City Ridgeline. The layers shown in our snowpit profile were similar to the ones in the crown of the avalanche.

Snowpit profile below. The red line indicates the weak layer on which the avalanche fractured.


 



The layer of concern is a varying thickness layer of facets sitting on top of a melt-freeze crust that likely formed during the end of November and the beginning of December. This facet crust interface has been seen widespread across the Park City Ridgeline. The avalanche failed within the weak facets sitting atop the supportable melt-freeze crust. The avalanche initially failed mid-slab in some places, stepping down to the melt-freeze crust, but did not step all the way into the facets at the ground in any places on the crown or slide path.

We experienced widespread collapsing riding in the trees underneath this slide. How do you feel a collapse while riding a sled? You can feel the track drop a little. Seeing small saplings shake 20-40' away is confirmation.

 

To be clear - collapsing told me that if we had gotten onto a steep slope, we would have triggered an avalanche. A collapse is everything that happens in an avalanche, except you're not on slope steep enough to slide.

Winds were calm to light AM and PM, brief period of light to moderate from SW mid morning.  No signs of human activity in the drainage, but some clues lying about to indicate some of the storm snow instabilities as result of weekend accumulations. I am not exactly sure when this avalanche in the first picture came down. But it is the first evidence of a natural avalanche I have personally seen of that size since the storm began. The bed surface had filled in a bit from the snows of yesterday and this morning.  But it looked to be 40-50 ft wide and ran just shy of 200 vertical before it slowed down just above the bench. Additional signs of Dry Loose activity and one small cornice block fall were also noted int he upper bowl under Silver Creek Pk. Heard snowmobile traffic late in the day further down canyon, which shows there is now enough snow to enter from the lowers.  Prior to this storm there was a wide spread surface hoar event in this region of AF.  Will be suspect of that layer as the slab begins to stiffen this week.  Targeted obs should be on this small grain weak layer over the terrain to determine its distribution and see how well it was preserved, noting the wind did not have a chance to knock it all down before the snow started Friday.

Strong south and southwest winds were loading snow onto slopes and creating a much denser slab of snow over the weak snow.  It seems that these winds are what the snowpack needed to make it more unstable and natural activity happen.  In this area, we found a 1 finger slab over faceted snow where the avalanche failed.  It would have been a nasty ride as this area has several rock bands that the avalanche ran through.

We aim to learn from accidents like this and in no way intend to point fingers at victims. All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center has had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. No one is immune to this. We asked Kurt's partner what he wanted to share, and these paraphrased bullet points are what he said:


	When any group member feels uncomfortable about riding a slope, that unease should be enough for the rest of the group not to ski it as well. He regrets not being more forceful in his desire to stay off the slope that avalanched. It is common for people in a group to have different opinions on what they think they should ski or ride, and it is important to communicate and understand the reason for those differences.
	We often practice avalanche rescue as if we start at the bottom or the top. Consider practicing how you would perform a search starting at the side of the avalanche. The partner said it was difficult to know if the victim was uphill or downhill from where he started his search.
	He was extremely grateful for everyone who helped with the rescue.
	They knew they were entering the backcountry when they exited the gate at the resort and were aware that if an avalanche happened it was their responsibility to conduct their own rescue.


*Final note from Kurt's partner - ""I want to share my belief that COVID had an impact on this accident. I realize now that I am exhausted from the 10+ months of near-constant stress COVID brings with worrying about my family, my friends, my work, etc. Plus financial stress, school closures, no physical contact with family members/friends, and so forth. As a result, my typical training, motivation, and mental reflection has been much less than a normal fall/winter. ""


 

Information in this report was collected from Park City Mountain Resort Ski Patrol and Summit County Sheriff's Office. Additionally, Trent Meisenheimer, Greg Gagne, and Chad Brackelsberg visited the site the day after the accident during the recovery. Additional details about the sequence of events were provided by the victim's partner, who performed a heroic rescue by himself. Unfortunately, this avalanche was fatal, but the partner gave the victim the best chance of living that few people could have matched. 

 

The staff of the Utah Avalanche Center sends its condolences to the family and friends of the victim.

Most of W Porter Fk slid overnight. There was about 4 inches of fresh snow on the debris at 8 am. There were a wide assortment of crowns, with depths ranging from 1 to about 4 ft and massive amounts of debris in the main section of the run. Aspects ranged from NW to N to NE. Debris was piled up down to nearly the thick aspens where the slope flattens. Many tracks from yesterday were covered and much of the popular run was bed surface now under 4 inches of fresh snow. There were numerous fir trees broken off, up to about 8 inches in diameter. The traditional skin track was hit in a few places and some of the paths were repeaters from earlier in the season. There was still some hang fire and we had no inclination to climb up to look at the starting zones. Our travel also took us to the area approaching Mt Raymond, below Raymond Glade, and we saw evidence of a large slide that appeared to come from the NW side of Mt Raymond, past the bottom of Piece of Pie, with debris reaching to the flat at the bottom of the small fir trees at about 8600 ft on the approach to Mt Raymond from the Main Porter Fork trail. It was noteworthy that there was evidence of a lot of skier traffic on Saturday. Since most of the popular skiable terrain was overun by the avalanche(s), it's a safe assumption that we dodged a bullet yesterday - waiting until late at night to slide was a stroke of good luck.



(A. Bellomy): 
Two very large natural avalanches along the headwall of West Porter Fork. The debris ran for approximately 1,800 vertical feet and 3/4 of a mile in distance. Dozens of ski tracks from the previous days and a few sections of the previous skin track were covered in debris. Trees up to 12"" thick were snapped in half and scattered throughout the debris. The only portion of the headwall that did not avalanche in this cycle had previously slid naturally about two weeks ago.

There was about 5"" inches of new snow on the debris which leads me to believe that it ran yesterday afternoon or early evening when the PI increased. There were various crown lines. Some that were 2.5-3.5 ft deep and a few places where it stepped all the way to the ground.

Note: I don't want to get on too much of a soap box, but this was a real eye opener for me. West Porter has grown in popularity over the last few years and a lot of people treat it as if it is a safe place to ski on higher avy danger days (myself included, admittedly). It is understandable because the main ski line is a very low angle and there are thick trees between the headwall and the main ski line. However, the reality is that West Porter has SIGNIFICANT overhead hazard from the surrounding headwall. Once you are above 8,200 feet you are exposed on three sides to a potential avalanche from above that can run through the trees and hit you on the skin track or ski lines. This is not a place I would recommend skiing on days of considerable or high avalanche danger.

But I'm inclined to think it's a new snow/storm snow avalanche that ran during the highest PI on the evening of 2/13 and failed in pooled graupel or some other density change from 2/12; there was no vegetation, textured or discolored snow, or chunks of hard slab on the bed surface or in the debris. The low density snow entrained in the slide ran all the way to the bottom of the ski run, though not quite to the creek, and triggered a step-down halfway down the path below a bushy bench.

 

Another possibility is that this avalanche does involve an older weak layer and perhaps it ran much earlier during the 2/12-2/14 storm, with hard slab debris now covered in 1-2' of blower. But I don't think it was a grounder.

 

We also saw another new snow pocket in the steep ESE facing terrain beneath the cliffs south of Hansen's, and a few real-looking avalanches on the flanks of High Pockets etc. on Kessler.

There were a couple skier-triggered, warm snow soft slabs in the early afternoon on S-SW facing Flagstaff.

Believed to have slid overnight 2/12. Observed the crown with clearing afternoon of 2/14 and went up to inspect today. Crown was staggered and broken but overall about 700' wide and anywhere from 2-6' deep. Areas along the flank were much shallower with a HS of just over 20'' in some places. Snowpack lacked any obvious temperature crusts or mid pack faceted layers and overall exhibited moderate strength, a fair bit of energy, and very poor structure with some of the most well developed facets I've observed so far this season. Some large areas of undisturbed snow left remaining high on the slope indicating the slide might have been triggered by some sloughing or spindrift from higher on the slope. Good clean out mid slope and debris ran to about 8400'. Did an okay job of laying down some of the willows and aspens just above the bench with a few larger trees mixed in the lot. Good indicator of potential for some of our other N facing paths but the poor structure, lack of previous activity, and still relatively thin HS at mid and low elevations has me skeptical those paths might hold on and deliver the large clean outs we're all hoping for. Hoping I'm wrong.

Photos were taken Feb 14. Date of slide is an estimate. Elevation and aspect are pretty accurate, and I am familiar with the slope angles in this area, which is a steep rollover into trees that is a clearly a change of character. As I don't see this slide in this year's list of observations, I thought it was worthwhile to report. 

A few sobering facts:

1. The fracture occurred on a rollover that is about 5 to 10 yards outside the area boundary. Two boundary signs are visible in the photos. 

2. Judging from the size of this fracture, and the evident debris pile at the bottom of this area, this fracture was approximately 2 to 3 feet deep at the crown, and propagated about 150 feet to skiers left, as there are related fractures visible to viewers right in the photos; and it ran about 1200 feet through thick trees, ending in a deposition pile in a large gully known as ""the Cemetery"". 

3. There are ski tracks above the fracture. I don't know if this was a natural or skier-triggered, but as it was the only slide in the area, and some of the only tracks in the area were directly above the fracture, it is possible it was skier-triggered.

A short slope that is probably in the lower 30 degree range avalanched and ran surprisingly far through low angle aspens. I'm guessing it came down sometime this morning because there was not a lot of new snow on the debris field. This seems like a pretty unusual place to see a natural avalanche which just speaks to how serious things are out there right now. I'd estimate that the crown was between 2 and 3 feet deep. I did not get too close so measurements are estimates. This area gets moderately loaded by the wind but certainly not as much as most areas under the high ridgelines on the Skyline.

 

This is yet another reminder that places that normally seem safe to travel are not right now. I certainly fell into the familiarity trap of having skied this area in all sorts of conditions and snowpacks and I shouldn't have been out there today.

The new dense slab is about a foot deep and while in many places it bonded well to the slick bed surface, slopes steeper than about 39 degrees were sensitive. Fresh cornices were also sensitive. On the uptrack out of Days I watched another party trigger a second slide in the chute immediately east of Two Dogs.

Not very surprising:  the October storms left enough snow at that elevation to turn into a facetfest, and any load on top of it was going to be suspect, of course West Monitor is a frequent flier, and this storm delivered a good load.   Oh, and there was some decent windloading from the SW, as per one of the photos looking over the ridge.  But even given that, we were surprised at the ease of the trigger; just one skier stepping onto the ridge 30 feet away and the whole thing ripped.    Let the annual Monitor reload/slide cycle begin.

A crack propogated through the firm near-flat ridgetop and across the entry zone of Toots about 80 yards to the far side of the run where it was slightly steeper and the slide released. It went to the very bottom of the run, moving very fast. We later saw evidence of a similar size slide about the same distance away in the other direction off the ridge, N facing and further W (dropping into Bowman Fk). We didn't see that slide, but are pretty sure that it triggered at the same time - it was very fresh when we went around the corner and saw it. Several interesting take-aways:

The crack propagated a long ways across a heavily wind-loaded slopeof at least 35 deg steepness and same exposure without triggering anything else

This was the first collapse we saw today (but not the last). We had been lapping a sub-30 deg NW facing slope prior.

A couple of large cornice falls just S onto a steep, wind-loaded slope, same elevation and aspect, didn't trigger anything

Both slides broke to the ground (repeaters?)

There was no one and no tracks below us that we could see.  We were nowhere near being caught but if a party was transitioning or skinning below us without getting well clear of the runout zone, they would have gotten a rude surprise.

The NW facing slope we had been lapping was getting still with windblown snow but the meter or so deep column I isolated at about 8600 ft (below the ridgeline) was pretty stout and I was unable to get a shear plane when I tried to pry it off. We were sticking to a lower angle slope with tres barely open enough to ski but saw no evidence of instability, making me think slopes exposed to direct wind are very different than lee slopes with some fetch.  No surprise.

We had joked about picking someone to ski cut that slope. That would have been a Very Bad Idea (we had no intention of actually doing that).

This confirmed that conditions are very tricky right now and, combined with our current lack of low-elevation snow, leave a pretty limited set of options for anyone wanting to do some serious powder riding.  This is a good oppotunity to practice patience and very conservative decision-making.

Yesterday, I spotted this large, well connected natural avalanche in Upper Weber Canyon.

Not particularly deep, averaging 4', yet lots of volume stacking up 10'-15' of debris on a bench-like terrain trap.

The terrain where it happened consists of a maybe 600 vertical foot headwall that is sparsely treed narrowing to a gully that runs for 2,500 vertical feet. This is a pretty rarely skied area, and is a quite massive slide path that seems to run big regularly. There was evidence of a very large avalanche presumably from early January that snapped many trees and ran full track, producing a massive, probably 15-20 foot deep debris pile at its toe.

 

I was skiing in a group of three, and we were using this run as an exit run late in the afternoon after skiing several runs on Santaquin. We all congregated at a safe spot on the ridge the top of the run, with a great visual of the entire slope (see attached photo.) With my partners watching I dropped into the run, skiing the headwall somewhat fast and aggressively. The snow was untracked and consisted of very deep near surface facets untouched by the wind and was excellent skiing. I slowed down as the terrain narrowed into a gully, and was hit with what felt like a wall of snow. I fought hard to self arrest, sliding with my feet facing downhill and arms digging in to the bed surface. I very briefly was buried and then came up to the surface again, and was just barely able to stop myself. Before I could breathe a sigh of relief I was hit by another wave, got carried again and can't remember if this one ever buried me but I was able to self-arrest more quickly this time. I then deployed the airbag on my pack in case another wave hit and skied to the side so I was out of the line of fire. I was probably carried a max of about 100 vertical feet but was barely able to self arrest and felt like I could have easily been carried much further. I lost a pole in the slide (but found it about 1,000 vertical feet lower) and sustained no injuries. The slide path was mostly clean but there was a rock band quite a bit lower that could have easily caused an injury had I been carried over it. I was shocked by how much snow there was and how fast it moved considering it was entirely my sluff that started following me as soon as I dropped into the line.

 

Takeaways:

 

1). We didn't respect the terrain and did not discuss potential hazards of skiing this particular line. Due to perceived low avalanche danger we didn't perform many of our usual protocols for skiing in avalanche terrain. A simple ski cut likely would have made me aware of this problem, instead I charged straight into the line. On a similar note, either checking over my shoulder or just checking up on the side before the run narrowed likely would have made this a non-issue. I definitely feel like I let my guard down big time.

 

2). We had skied two other runs previously, on NW and N aspects and sluffing was only a minor concern. Additionally we have done quite a bit of skiing these past few weeks and any encounters with this snow stability problem were very manageable and unremarkable. While similar in steepness to our previous runs, our last run was quite a bit more radical in terms of terrain features and runout zones. Additionally the snowpack was much shallower due to the large January avalanche and this may have contributed to the snow being even more faceted and weak.

 

3). Radios may have helped in this situation. My partner yelled at me when he saw what was happening but I was already too far down the slope and couldn't hear him.

 

I was amazed at the sheer volume of snow that came down solely from my sluff. While being a somewhat unusal problem with our faceted snowpack it is definitely something that I will be much more vigilant about going forwards. Photo is a top-down view of the run before we skied it.

The slab itself only ran for 30 or 40 feet, but then captured some loose snow, causing the entire avalanche to run for about 100 feet. There was certainly enough snow to knock a skier off their feet. Overall, the wind loading on the South Face was pretty limited and spatially variable.

We're still sifting through details, but here's what we know about a close call late Monday afternoon near Humpy Peak-

A group of sledders is riding in the Humpy drainage when one snowmobiler triggers a connected piece of snow on a steep, north facing slope which catches, carries, and buries another rider in a terrain trap (small gully). The rider tries to deploy his airbag, though is unable to successfully engage and he's buried with a hand sticking out of the snow. The sledder briefly loses consciousness, but everyone in the group is wearing avalanche rescue gear and they quickly locate the buried rider and dig him out. The group is pretty rattled, but after taking some time to regroup in the Whitney Basin warming hut, they ride back to their rigs and return home safely.. Whew... close call!

The Preciousness of Life

 

March 13th, 2022

 

Yesterday I was involved in a rescue and I will tell the story here. 

 

Willie and I were guiding 6 women, two of them had their Avalanche 1 training and one had her avalanche 2 training.   We planned a bi-canyon tour so we dropped a car at the base of BCC and met at the swamp lot and took the bus up to Alta.  We review the current conditions and avalanche hazards with them and looked a the photos of avalanches from the day before.  We discussed the state of the snowpack, and we talked about what to do if there was an avalanche while at the bus stop. 

 

At the trailhead, we did beacon range checks and headed up.  On the way up we dug on two north-facing knolls to see the weak layer.  At Chad's gap, 9300’ we dug a pit on NW facing.  HS was 100cm, there was 40 cm of new snow  (F-1F hardness) on top of Fist hardness facets (10cm) with 4 F facets below that.  The facets were wet and I could make a snowball with them.  I had no result on the Compression Test. 

 

4 girls were faster so I took them up to East pass to assess the snowpack there.  I popped just over the pass and probed.  The snowpack was 320cm deep.  I dug about a meter down and was nowhere near the weak layer as there was a lot of wind-blown snow there.  The winds had been blowing upslope and depositing snow before making it over the ridge.  It was not a sensitive slab in that spot.  I decided that I could not accurately test the weak layer that was going to be only two feet deep further down the slope, so I decided not to ski the slope.  

 

Willie arrived with the other two.  I told him we were going to go up to East Peak, traverse down the NW ridge to the lower angle saddle, and skid into the east bowl from there.  Willie said he thought his two needed a shorter hike, one had flown in the day before from sea level, and said that he was going up Davenport and would ski Cabin Ridgeline and meet me there. 

 

We skied into an east bowl and got to the bottom where the skin track heads back up to the west bowl.  We stopped on the bench absove the gully so as not to be in the gully.  I had just taken off my skies and pulled out my skins when we heard the other party above us.  Willie had them ski one at a time down to me.  The first girl skied down to us with no incident.  The second was halfway down the slope when it triggered.  I yelled avalanche and told her to ski out of there.  She cut to the side out of the path easily.  Willie had yelled avalanche too.  I thought he was at the top.  I did not see him go down with the avalanche.  I yelled for him and when he didn’t answer we knew he was buried.  

 

I approximate the slide was a SS about 100’ long, 40’ wide, and 2’ deep.  The slope angle was over 35.  

 

I had one girl call 911, everyone turned to search, I and another gal booted over to the debris pile and began searching the other gals put on their skins in case that was faster as we did not know how high up he might be.  The debris had gone through lots of trees.  The debris was soft and deep. I was wallowing but made it up to him.  The woman that had traversed out of the slide came over from above to help.  

 

My heart sank when I saw that my lowest number was 1.6.  I did a grid box at 1.8 in all 4 directions.  Someone handed me a probe and the girls began clearing the snow below as I probed.  We got a strike that was about 150cm down.  

 

We dug like mad and first got to his boot.  His boot was higher and his body went diagonally down and he was face down.  It took a while to get him out.  We next got to the pack and it was still a long way to get his face and airway out.  We got an airway after 23 minutes.  He had a pulse and was barely breathing.   One woman held his face as we continued to dig out his buried arm and leg that were still deeper.  It took a lot of work to get him onto his back. We all got in there and did a roll.  He was unconscious but alive.  

 

Shorter after the solitude ski patrol arrived and then several Wasatch powder bird guides.  

 

Another backcountry party was skiing down a gully above us where the silver fork drainage takes a bend.  They triggered a small slide there and though the debris did not come close to us, it highlighted the danger around us being in the gully.  

 

We all worked together to get him on a sled and tried to warm him.  He started to gain consciousness and was screaming in pain as he had some fractures ribs and nose and a busted eye.   He was talking before we got to the LZ but he was cold.  

 

It was about 2 hours from the incident to get him long-lined out by helicopter from a safe landing zone further down.  The patrol did amazing dragging him out above the gully on the right-hand side.  The landing zone was below the gully on a bench to the right looking down the canyon.  

 

As I process the incident I keep feeling so grateful for the 6 women who dug so hard, for the patrollers and rescuers who helped, for Willie, for my family, for our community, and all of the people who reached out with love.  I am grateful for solitude and their support and taking care of us afterward.  And received the helicopter rescue.  

 

It drives home to me how precious this life is, the breath of life in each moment is a gift.  And I recognize the beauty of each person.  We are all lucky to be alive here on this planet.  

 

Check your slope angles carefully out there.  I was using my cal topo slope angle shading all day today to find a safe way down.  This snowpack is not to be trusted right now.  

Additional takeaways from Winslow: 


1.  I carry a nasopharyngeal, which we used as we were unsure of his airway. We ended up taking it out, but I was glad to have it.  It could save a life. 

 

2.  Make sure your “safe spot” is a safe spot.

While descending a ridge between 2 chutes, I broke through the snow and punched my ski tips down into the layer of loose facets. This caused me to fall and instantly trigger the slab. I estimate the slab broke 2' deep and 40' wide. I was carried roughly 350' down the slope. I deployed my airbag and was on the surface when the debris came to rest. This avalanche occurred far down off the ridge in a part of the slope that is fairly sheltered from the wind and sun. 

 

I'm still thinking through the incident and lessons to share but 2 critical errors that stand out to me are: 

1. I thought that I could manage the terrain to avoid the avalanche problem. 

2. I thought that the most likely place to trigger the avalanche would be high up on the slope and close to the ridge in one of the primary start zones.

An experienced group triggered a very large avalanche in Big Cottonwood Canyon in Mineral Fork on Barrieto. The avalanche was skier-triggered when they dropped in for a slope cut. The skier triggered the slab, and it propagated 600 feet wide 2-4 feet deep and ran 1600 vertical feet to the bottom, crossing the creek and traveling up the other side of the drainage. Luckily, nobody was caught in this beast of an avalanche.

This remotely triggered slide breaking 2' deep and about 300' wide was initiated from about 40' away while a rider descended a low angle, 30 degree, north facing slope. This a go-to safe slope in Weber Canyon and the riders were doing everything right. However, a remotely triggered avalanche speaks to the tricky nature of our snowpack setup.

The largest slide triggered today was on the NE aspect of LSB. Interesting conditions here where the NW winds from the end of the storm scoured the surface leaving a sculpted, benign look. Most of the snow was being transported onto the south face. The first skier traveled around and to the right of the steep ominous pocket. I was the second skier. A few turns into the run I noticed a deeper pocket at a steep breakover and pulled up to ski cut it. The slide failed at my skis at a density change between the last two storms and propagated 30' wide. It stopped at the transition to lower angle 3/4 of the way down the slope. The debris was only a foot or so deep and not likely enough to bury someone but still, you wouldn't want to be caught up in it. I think the gusty NW wind contributed to stiffening the snow from the last two storms creating the slab on an aspect that was also getting scoured. Not your normal windslab.

We came across this avalanche that a few riders said they triggered just a few minutes earlier. One rider started up the hill went across and triggered it but was able to get out safely. We did not go up to the crown to see how deep it was but I assume it was 2-3 feet deep. We took the opportunity it do a little avalanche training with my 13 year old boy. I had him search for me with his beacon, probe, and then dig a hole to pretend to dig me out. It was a good learning experience for him. That week layer is still there and probably will be till the snow is gone. Be careful out there.

 

Something amusing about this close call is that I stumbled onto this avalanche after the father and his son were done practicing and had left.  So I go up to look at the avalanche and I see sled tracks and boot tracks all over the debris and a big hole where someone was digging!  Of course I thought that someone had been caught, buried and dug up!  What a relief to hear that someone was using the debris for rescue practice.

In slow motion I saw snow rippling around me, realized it was sluffing and took a quick peek back and saw either a crown or my ski cut, I'm not sure.  Tried to hit the gas but the snow was too deep and too slow.  Got caught and briefly laid out, long enough to consciously make a list of several reasons I made a stupid decision (below), but I did a hand check, caught my feet and started skiing out but then quickly darted back over to where the snow ran ahead of me.  Visibility sucked and I was mad at myself so I took off without pics.  

 

I feel like an idiot so I'm sharing in case it helps even one person avoid my mistakes.  

 

1.  Barely looked at the UAC because I think the forecast was still from yesterday and I didn't even notice

2  Didn't even consider the airbag though I saw some big snow totals 

2.5ish   Didn't call my buddies even though I knew they would also be out, because sometimes I like being alone

3  Heard bombing all the way up, but I was still looking for something high and steep, 'because the storm was warm and the snow is a bit heavy'  

4  Saw clear signs of wind loading

5  Familiarity

6  Time constraint

7  Knew the risk, but was cavalier about my ability to handle it.

 

Made some calls to snow safety and police to notifiy that I was fine and avoid putting others at risk.  Maybe the only good choice I made.  Be careful out there, I like a margin of safety and I got too close or crossed it today.

I found a pencil to one finger hard layer that formed during the beginning of the last storm cycle.  On top of that was a one finger hard wind slab and what appeared and felt like small grained facets between the wet and cold layers however I didn't take pics of crystals to verify.  This was all new wind slab and no old snow pulled out.  Just a few feet away from the slide, and off the slab, I found blower light power on top of our rain /wet snow layer that formed at the beginning of the last storm.  Unrelated to the slide, I found noticeable basal facets up to 8 cm thick at the ground interface.

Added Notes:  I ran into a group and they asked me when the slide occurred before I had skied it.  I didn't see any evidence of a slide or crown at that point but the light was a little flat at that point and they had come form another vantage point than myself.  I did notice that on Friday someone had put an up track in the middle of the slope adjacent to the slide within 100 feet of the skiers right flank.  Also when investigating, I noticed part of the crown closer to the skin track was filled in more than I suspected.  I even dug around a little to see how fresh the snow was below the crown and judging by the density of the new blown in snow it seemed like that section of the crown could have been from day before.  I suspect the skinner remote triggered the slide just as I did at the bottom of my run.  Looking at the very last pick we see the second slide pulled even closer to the skin track.  The swatch of the slope was clean where I had skied and as you can see in the second to last pic the runout is centered on my tracks.

Noted both hard wind crust and soft snow. This is not a particularly steep area, maybe 30 degrees where I transitioned so was somewhat surprise to have the slope fracture on my second turn and sweep me off balance. Fortunately, the avalanche was not deep but I did go for an unwanted ride. Managed to lose a pole as I kept a handle on my airbag trigger but did not have to deploy. As has been noted by others the crust is not well bonded to underlying snow and is reason for concern.

 

The spot where I entered the chute was approximately 15 feet in width and my transition here could possible have created weakness in the snowpack. As I initiated my second turn on some firm wind crust the slope fractured and swept me off my feet. I was carried for 350 feet and total length of avalanche was 550 ft with a maximum width of 70 feet. Fortunately, the depth was not great and I was able to maintain a feet first position and avoid being consumed by debris nor did I have to deploy my airbag. It was difficult to determine the initial fracturing layer depth at the crown but some of the blocks towards the toe were in excess of 12"". This is heavily wind impacted area with rock outcroppings that could have been a contributing factor.

Like many folks, we sniveled into Mill D today to get some nice powder in non-avy terrain, and skinned up to ski the Weathering Heights shot.   On top - where the overnight winds that accompanied the new snow were abating, but still blowing a bit - we had a remote trigger of a bunch of cracking on the low angle terrain below the small cornice, then purposely got lots of additional cracking with kicking at the cornice (it's so low angle up there that there's no chance of it running).  We skied one run, and at the bottom as we were skinning we saw a skier come swooping into the bottom of the run across the way (Powder Park?) and as he went by the slope ""avalanched"" as it rolled the last 5 vertical feet into the creek bottom.  ie it had all the elements of an avalanche:  crown, adjacent cracks, etc - but it literally only went 5 vertical feet.  But enough to realize that the 'pack is unstable, even down in the bottom of the drainage where there's no wind effect.  

 

On our second run I was rolling down a slightly-less-weedy slope that was closing out in more weeds and as I cut over to the adjacent rib that was more open I suddenly realized that I was skiing into the moving debris of another micro avalanche that I remotely triggered as I closed in.  It was basically the roll off of a sub-ridge, one of the couple of steep spots in the entire area.  This one was many times bigger than the one in the drainage; it ran maybe 20 vertical feet.  So honestly, no big deal; the overall slope angle was low, there was virtually no debris pile where the ""avalanche"" pretty much spread onto a very low-angle slope below, etc.  But it was a sobering example of the instabilities that exist at the moment. 

 

Digging a bit I found I couldn't isolate a column before it pulled out, and it seemed to me that there were two places:  one at the new snow/old snow interface, and another a mid-storm instability a coupla/few inches up from the old base (which together effectively made it a surprisingly thick overall weak interface).  

 

It was great to ski blower powder (esp since we missed the well-documented first storm cycle earlier this month) but overall it was a bit slow due perhaps in part to the cold snow but mostly because we weren't willing to ski anything with any pitch (aside from my little sub-ridge roll, that honestly I was oblivious to).  I hope that weak interface gets buried/crushed and it eventually will, but at the moment I think that it will be a bit Persistent for a while, and the excitement will likely increase with the anticipated snow later this week.  'Tis the season, I suppose.  

 

We didn't ski anything south facing today; a bit too thin yet, though I was guessing that the more filled in south facing terrain in LCC that I skied over the weekend would behave much differently with the denture-rattling base underneath.

The right and left flanks tapered down to 1'. It was estimated to be 300' wide and ran 500' vertically before stopping in the flats.  This would have been an unsurvivable avalanche.

It was difficult to determine a trigger, however there were snowmobile tracks on the ridgetop adjacent to the slide. The crown spanned aspects from east- northeast and there was some variability in the hardness of the wind slab over the weak layer throughout the crown face. 

 

The weak layer was approximately 80cm off of the ground and consisted of a very thin melt freeze crust with small grained facets above and below.  There were sections of the bed surface that were over 1 meter deep. What this tells us is that the weak layer is elevated off of the ground.  What this means for us as backcountry travelers is that the potential for much larger avalanches could be more prevalent this season.

This avalanche occurred in closed terrain within the Park City Ski Area Boundary and resembles backcountry terrain in similar areas. 

 

As you travel near ski areas please respect their ski area boundaries. Check out resort uphill policies here. 

If you see or are involved in any avalanches around ski area boundaries please report them to the appropriate rescue organization.

Viewed it within an hour or less of it happening by the lack of new snow on the bed surface. Person appeared to be riding down the Dog Lake Chutes and made a cross slope turn and initiated a wide/substantial Dry Loose Avalanche that dug down to the old snow new snow interface upon descent, and was at least 90 feet wide. Tracks rode out of the debris. The debris piled up to be at least 2 feet if not 3 and ran to the transition. Of note the entire rider's right half of the Main Dog Lake Chute had multiple Natural Dry Loose Avalanches that appeared to be initiating from  the steep North facing cliff bands and these also ran to the transitions. Hand Shears and Tilt Tests confirmed the obvious weakness that only got deeper as the day progressed. Snow fall rates were sustained in the S3 to S4 range for the most of the entire day with HN from 0900 exceeding 6 inches, and the HST 14 inches. Snow was extremely light density and there was good bonding to the old snow/new snow interface as the storm came in Rightside up. Still experiencing isolated collapsing, but as visibility was poor most of the day it was difficult to see any other Avalanche Activity.

It was determined that no one was caught buried by three things together:


	Witnesses were interviewed by the PCMR Canyons Ski Patrol, and no one reported seeing anyone caught in the slide.
	People in the area searched the debris with avalanche transceivers 
	Utah Dept. Of Public Safety searched the debris with a helicopter mounted RECCO device.

Also likely that there was graupel pooling involved as the Crown was directly under these steep cliffs, and the first part of the event had at least 4 inches of grauple in many locations. Avalanche was SS-N D2. Only significant avalanche observed in the Snake Creek drainage off of he East ridge of Sunset. As observed throughout the region, widespread Natural Loose Dry Avalanche Cycle was evident on all steep terrain on all aspects with one digging down in the NE chutes directly off of Sunset Peak. 

 

Riding was good on SE and S, but the solar effects came into play by 1130 and there will be a m/f crust on these aspects on Wednesday.

I looked down the cornice and saw no one below and half thoughtlessly gave it a minor tap with my pole. The cornice broke back about 1' from the edge and propagated up and downslope for about 50' feet in the last couple days wind deposit. The avalanche then ran for about 100' downslope and ended in the pines.

This made for an adequate sliding surface for this relatively soft slab to run on given a steep enough slope.

This was on a ridge to the NW of the weather station. 

 

My plan was to ski the ridge down into trees and to cut the slope on my way over. I have seen this slope release multiple times. It seems to have the right combination of convex roll leading into a steeper section (35-38 degrees) along with terrain driven winds that must deposit close to the loading point on the convexity. Its a short shot, but can be dangerous as it drains into some trees. 

 

It was the end of my day, and I made a tired and lazy decision that I was high enough up on the ridge to cut the slope. 

 

The slope broke above me at the new snow old surface interface, then stepped down about 8-6"" onto facets above what I believe is the old dry spell layer. 

 

I was able to carry momentum and ski off to the north. 

 

There was a small amount of hangfire left at the crown slope convexity, but not enough to worry me, so I went back to take a look and investigate the snow layering. 

 

I made a really bad terrain management call, but this slide shows the fragility of the snowpack and the tricky layering we are experiencing. 

 

I added a pic of some slides/releases on the Lomond headwall.

Rather than climb back up to exit lower angle slopes we mistakenly decided to ski a steeper slope that we had skied several times this season. The first skier skied 6-8 turns to an island of safety and then the second skier joined the first. The third skier came down from above us to skiers left and skied the slope without incident to a lower ridge which is usually safe. The second skier then followed him down. On his third turn the slope fractured 100' above him and began to move. The first skier yelled avalanche and instructed the second skier to go left. At the same time the slope to the right fractured and slid to the ground. Another slope to our left also released and slid about the same time.

He took a beating as he was carried through maple and scrub oak. He was pinned to the ground by dense snow around his pack unable to move until he unbuckled his pack. He stood up and found one ski nearby and I located the other ski above him in some scrub oak.

He described being caught and carried, tumbling in the snow seeing nothing but white until he came to a stop on the surface. He was pummeled by snow and branches as he was carried down the slope. No major injuries occurred but he will be bruised and pulled a hamstring. He thought he was taking his last breath and so did I. It's not a good feeling. We were lucky he was ok and able to ski out. The ridge we skied out was noted to crack more than 20 times on our exit but wasn't steep enough to slide.

What did we do wrong? We didn't pay attention to the obvious and significant cracking and collapsing as we skinned up. This was at the same elevation as the avalanche we triggered.  We chose an exit from the mountain that was too steep because we didn't want to hike up to a lower angle exit. We were lulled to sleep by good skiing earlier in the day. We didn't do a proper ski cut before skiing this slope. We didn't fully understand the effects that 4 inches of rain had on the snow pack. We thought the rain would stabilize the snow pack but it completely saturated the snow to the ground making it weaker. We didn't register or heed advice from UAC forecast.

What did we do right? We reviewed the UAC forecast before our tour. We skied one at a time utilizing islands of safety above and below the slope that avalanched. We were equipped with beacons, probes and shovels and knew how to use this gear. We practice with our beacons, probes and shovels.  We reported this slide so others can learn from our mistakes. It's embarrassing to admit we screwed up.

In summary we messed up and were very lucky that things didn't turn out worse.

*Forecaster note: Thank you for the write up and sharing the information -

 

Dropped into conehead for my third run of the morning, 2nd on conehead and the 4th set of tracks on the slope. On my 3rd or 4th turn I saw the slope start to break up and immediately cut hard right. This resulted in being taken off my feet and being carried approximately 30-40 yards. I dropped a pole and went to airbag handle but gave one hard stomp with my downhill ski and got lucky. It caught, put me back on my feet and allowed me to ski out of the slide to skiers right.



Being able to ski out of this slide was beyond lucky and should not have happened. This was a huge wake up call on being too comfortable with familiar terrain and not giving the heavy storm load the full respect it deserves.

 

best guess the crown was approximately 18-24"" deep.

Based on the amount of new snow on top of the debris we are guessing it went last night or in the afternoon yesterday. Hard to tell if it was natural or triggered by a near by ski track (skier's left). Starting on the looker's left side of the slide it was about 3.5' deep and got shallower the further looker's right it went down to about 1'. In some places it went to the ground and in other it looked like it was within the old snow. Not crazy huge, but definely enough to bury a person especially considering it dumped right into the gully. Quite a few ski tracks around it. We also had a couple of loud collapses that had our hairs standing on end today.

Skier 1 traversed safety to another sub ridge and I dropped in for about four or five turns actually before it was cracking up so me and skier 1 traversed the sub ridge even more because it was starting to come at us from above. Skier 3 was blinded and taking pauses in the high winds on the main ridge but was able to navigate the crown and bed surface to us to regroup. I watched the avalanche pick up speed and we skied down investigated the debris field which ran about 2000' vert, snapped small maples and into a small gully...

 

I'm glad no one was caught. The wind even without storm snow was fierce, and very difficult to do anything. It pushed the danger scale way up and as a group it was definitely a good thing to have options and it should be noted that this is the first aggressive bowl of the Wellsvilles. Ski cutting into the bowl vs going out the way we came up was the reason this slide was triggered. It's hard to say what could have gone differently.

Today we dropped into Greaseball Couloir just north of the summit of Kessler Peak with the plan to ride out Argenta. On our way up, we dug a snowpit to test stability and found no deep instabilities in the snow structure. As we approached the ridge of Kessler we noticed a lot of wind coming over the ridge and depositing on the North face. We did some stability stomps and were unable to get anything to propagate or observe any shooting cracks. As we traversed from the summit of Kessler to the entrance of the line, we started noticing cross loading beneath the top of the couloir which was causing some strange wind pockets and small cornices. To test the stability of the cross loaded surface, I stood back and stomped at the base of a cornice about the size of a small fridge. The cornice broke and dropped onto the slope without causing any propagation on the slope below. Outside the cross loading, the majority of the wind gusts were coming up the couloir and depositing snow onto the East Face of Kessler. Which made us believe that there likely wasn't any widespread wind loading issues in the couloir proper.
 

I descended first and dropped into the hanging bowl, after making a heel side turn, an isolated wind slab broke loose below and above me which knocked me off my feet and took me for a ride. I was able to keep the majority of my body above the snow and was able to radio my partner that I was sliding with the debris. I made swimming motions with my arms and kicked my board to help keep me on top. After about 300 feet, I was able to slow down and stop, while the rest of the debris released below me. After regrouping, we descended the debris. The slope slid about 1,300 feet. 
 

Mistakes / Learnings: 



-Respect the wind. Even a small ""manageable"" wind pocket can break and carry you a long way in steep terrain with long runouts. 



-Cross loading is serious. I had read the avy forecast and knew that wind was a problem, but I did not anticipate cross loading to be as obvious as a problem, as this is less common in the Wasatch. Lesson learned.



-Make a ski cut. I think I could have mitigated some hazard had I made a ski cut before dropping onto the hanging snow field.

As I approached the cornice, it failed triggering the slab below which propagated surprisingly 300' wide with some speed and energy. The slope was small so it ended only 100' below in the lower angle treed slope but piled up quite deep. The slope angle directly below the cornice was steep at 39-40 deg. for a short distance. I think it needed this pitch as lower angle slopes were less sensitive and more stubborn. The weak layer was a density inversion at the old snow interface about 30-40cm down. I didnt do any tests in the hangfire as most all of the slope had avalanched but Gagne has a pertinent observation on a nearby slope that highlights this same weakness.

The rocks were about 35 feet above us and the slope was 20 feet wide.  After discussing options/precautions, skier 2 (submitter) stayed back in a safe spot while skier 1 stepped out into the slope. Skier 1's steps quickly triggered a slide in the new snow layer--roughly 6"" on average and starting all the way from the rocks above. Skier 1 stayed in place on their feet during the slide then continued across to sub 30 degree terrain just beyond the slope. 

 

The slide was 20 feet wide and went 200+ feet downhill. At it's deepest, the new snow layer there was 8"" but was only 3"" up at the rocks. The slope where skier 1 triggered it from was 39 degrees. At it's steepest by the rocks above, we would estimate the slope was nearly 45 degrees. 

 

Overall the slide was small and the skier had no trouble standing in place while it happened. No movement at all in the 33 degree and 28 degree terrain over ridges on either side. However, we both immeadiately recognized that in larger terrain, the same situation could have been much worse. We double checked our plan and adjusted for extra caution.

 

Continued our day and saw no other red flags above this point. However, we were getting a lot of sluffing, cracking, and movement in the snow at much lower elevations on our way out.

 

It was a nice reminder that established skin tracks are not always the best option. On our way out we realized cutting over 250' lower in elevation would have completed avoided this terrain.

As I cut a traverse to ski the Sunset doors, I triggered first a D1 soft slab at my feet before the cliff (pictured, skier in photo), and past the cliff, a D1 soft slab broke 50 feet above me, and ran past me, luckily without sweeping me off my feet.

I found that the weak grain in question appeared to be buried stellar dendrites, and I couldn't tell, but maybe some needles were included. In any case, these grains (pictured) reliably produced failures 30cm down on all aspects in handpits. I don't know what changed within the new snow to create this instability, as the snowpack is otherwise rightside up.

Looking back up, it looked like the crown was about a foot at its deepest and 25-30' wide. In hindsight, ski crampons and sticking to the windward side would have been the safer option and had the terrain below/ adjacent been steeper and more connected, I wouldn't have chosen this route up at all.

Party of 3 climbed to Cardiff Pass then west toward Superior. Experienced moderate wind and a few stronger gusts - consistent with the last few days' forecasts. Stopped to transition just short of Little Superior intending to ride the higher ground on SE aspect. First rider began to traverse right to reach that point and triggered the slab within seconds. Party member above reports feeling a collapse underfoot - it's possible the trigger was from above. Rider attempted to move right and didn't make much progress before falling into seated position and ""swimming"" to stay on top. Rider was carried about 60 feet before coming to a stop without burial. The slide ran at least 800? vertical feet down the gully towards Two Trees - didn't get a great look at the full path on the exit. Party continued right and descended ridges.

 
In hindsight:

- We did not respect the forecast in our terrain choice. The group was familiar with recent forecasts and discussed impact of the wind multiple times but opted to continue with original objective after *very* casual observations along the skin track didn't expose activity.

- A few tens of yards of climbing could have made the difference in terrain. Because we stopped short it was necessary to make a small traverse to the safer high ground, but doing so meant crossing above an obvious trap. Transitioning a bit further ahead would have kept us out of the gully and on safer terrain from the start.

- The transition had thin cover in places and exposed rocks. Could have noted the weak point and taken it into account.

 

Close call and humbling for sure.

This avalanche occurred above the summer road very close to the uphill skin track into Grizzly Gulch.



If you trigger or see an avalanche adjacent to the road or one of the ski areas and are sure no one was caught in the avalanche, call the nearest mountain dispatch and alert them to the situation, this will allow search and rescue teams to stand down, preventing them from being subjected to unnecessary hazard.

Craig and Shaun take a look at Saturday's slide. A very experienced crew with decades of backcountry knowledge and safe travel practices were surprised (as was I) by a slide they triggered mid-slope, on a low elevation (8600'), northwest facing slope in the Mill Hollow zone.

 



 

Breaking about 18"" deep and 100' wide, the slide failed on a layer of weak, sugary, near surface facets formed on 1/23 and buried during last weeks storms.

 

 



Even a small avy is powerful enough to break a Quaky.

We planned to ski the wolverine shoulder down back into Alta ski area. Skier 1 skied far right on the shoulder, Skier two skied left of that track closer to the bowl, and skier three skied even further left. Skier three triggered the avalanche and was able to self arrest/ski off the slab. We re-grouped on the lower shoulder and although we were mostly confident nobody was in the basin where the avalanche ran into, out of an abundance of caution we sent one skier down to perform a transceiver search.

 

With two of us remaining on the shoulder to watch for any remaining hangfire from above, skier 2 skied onto the bed surface just uphill of the skiers right flank and performed a tranceiver signal search of the debris with no results or signal found. No tracks were noted in the area and we were now confident that nobody was buried in the avalanche. At this point we called Alta Ski Patrol to notify them of the avalanche and inform them that we had performed a transceiver search with no results. The two skiers on the shoulder then followed skier 2's tracks onto the bed surface to perform a crown profile while skier 2 transitioned and skinned back up the bed surface to the rest of the party.

 

We then skied back into the ski area via lower Patsy Marley, coming across another smaller avalanche which ASP was already aware of, and we performed a signal search with patrol there as well.  Overall, a more sensitive snowpack than we anticipated out there today, this one caught us off guard and we're lucky we didn't have a more serious involvement. Old sun crust/new snow combo being the main problem to watch as this storm continues to load tonight, especially when the sun pops out tomorrow and settlement rates increase.

I hiked up to the ridge with my dog, strapped on my board, and called my wife to have her record me riding down the slope.  As I started riding down, I hooted and hollered a little.  I heard a soft sound almost like the rustling of leaves, and looked to my left to see a large area of snow sliding down the slope.  It almost looked like molten lava flowing down the mountainside.  Once I realized what was happening, I looked above me and around me - thankfully nothing above me was sliding.  Once the avalanche stopped, I called my dog and rode down to the bottom.  I felt very lucky that I chose to ride just 100 or so feet to the east of where the slide occurred, and not right on it.  I was also glad that the avalanche did not hit my neighbors houses.

 

My wife got half of the avalanche on video, and didn't realize the avalanche was there until she was watching the video after all was said and done. By inspecting the video, it looks like it was a big wind drift on the down-wind side of the ridge that broke loose.

At one point near the ridge into E facing Mill A, we backed off from walking across on particularly rounded pillow of snow, and then triggered the slide remotely from about 20' away while walking away from the open slope across a thin spot. The slide ran at least 1000' vertical, produced a dust cloud, and appeared to shake some big trees. 

 

Adding this text-only observation a day late because in hindsight it seems like the avalanche could have failed in a radiation-recrystalization or other NSF/crust combo that developed on 1/26. Initially we assumed it failed in pooled graupel, but the steep, planar slope seems more likely to bear some RR etc. than pooled graupel. No pics and no actual forensics because the light was bad and we were above the crown; so it's really just a hunch. But it seems like in some places there's complexity in the upper snowpack right now that folks (like me) don't always factor in, or dig down to evaluate, when they're mostly thinking about windslabs. Will it settle out with the frigid temps or in a few days?

While skinning up towards Pole-line/Cardiff pass, we noticed a small avalanche on the southwest side of the Flagstaff shoulder with one ski track entering the crown, and we were unable to see any ski tracks exiting the debris or slope. We shifted directions towards the avalanche, and once at the bottom still could not see any tracks exiting. Despite the small size of the avalanche, we were concerned about a potential hangup in the trees within the path for the involved party. We decided to send two from our group of 5 up to perform a transceiver signal search because it appeared that the individual may have been traveling alone. The remaining group members stayed in the flats, keeping eyes on the hanging snow above, and called Alta Central to inform them of the situation, so Alta Ski Patrol could standby if the signal search yielded results. We turned our beacons to search at the toe of the debris, and continued to switchback up the slope, spacing out ~50 feet. The debris in the open snow, for the most part, was not deep enough to bury a human. On the trees there was debris piled up to 7 feet deep.

 

After we reached the stauchwall(roughly) we were finally able to see a ski track exiting to the skier's right, through the trees, traversing far out on the slope away from the avalanche. Given the traversing nature of the track, it was almost impossible to see from a downhill angle. At this point, we put our transceivers back into send, and communicated the info back down to the rest of our party below so they could communicate back to Alta Central. Out of an abundance of caution, we sent one skier up to the uppermost trees, the last point where anyone involved in the avalanche could have been pinned. It seemed that the involved party had indeed arrested, pinned, or otherwise stopped against these trees, and then skied out. Hard to tell exactly, but this is my best guess. From here I traversed over to the crown to perform a quick profile, then skied back down to the rest of the group. Picture of the trees from uphill included below. Thankful there wasn't any serious involvement in this avalanche!

A UAC forecaster visited this slide on Wed, Feb 1st - additional notes from the UAC: 
The avalanche failed on a S/SE facing aspect at 9400'. This slide failed as a slab of wind drifted snow on a layer of small grain facets above a solar crust. The slab was between 10-20"" deep. While it is hard to tell if it failed on small grain facets that were formed by radiation recrystallization, the setup seems. Small grain facets exist below the crust as well. Radiation recrystallization was occurring on the surface above the crown. 

Notes from Tim: 
This morning before work I got in a quick Beartrap Aspens lap. From the ridge summit of Aspens, around 8800 feet, I noticed a large southeast-facing slide off of the West Willow Ridgeline into Mule Hollow. I've skied that aspect and area several times this year, but in less sensitive snowpack conditions, and was personally surprised to see a slide there, especially since the WBSkiing app has this area labeled white, aka not steep enough to slide. It's a good lesson to use the app only as general guideline when observing slope aspects and steepness. 

If I had to guess, I'd say the slide is a few hundred feet long and wide, and several feet deep. Based on where I was standing on the lower ridge summit below, I'd guess the cause was natural due to heavy wind loading from the most recent storm, and that this slide probably happened over the weekend. I did not notice any tracks going in, or near, the slide path, so I did not feel it was necessary to ski into Mule Hollow and do a proper beacon search. If I had seen tracks going into the slide, I probably would have done so. 
 

Looking forward to the snowpack healing up again to sneak in some bigger lines. Stay safe people.

Other than the several day old naturals avalanches, we were not able to get anything to slide today.  There was plenty of wind loading from this week and we found significant sastrugi along all the ridge lines (see pic 2).  Riding was not stellar at upper elevations due to all the wind affected zones.  Even where the snow looked good, there were stout wind drifts in unexpected locations. We rode east, south, and west facing slopes and actually found the best riding on south facing slopes.

Had a route planned to climb and to ski what we believed to be safe and protected from the recent winds. We had discussed the possible danger, and wind slabs were the top of the list to look out for. The planned climbing route is one I had used a few times in years past, but had most often used as a descent route. As I was climbing I noticed the wind cross loading slopes well above us, and we discussed the route that we planned to ski as it may have been in that zone. But we did not discuss the climbing route as we were not seeing much wind transport in that area. 

 

The initial ascent route was in a tight creek bottom. Anything with some south aspect had rollerballed and had a stout crust from the day before. Just a few feet away north facing felt soft, with a slight density inversion 6-8"" down. The skin track varied from crust stout enough to not break through, up to 8 inches of ski penetration. The light was very flat, and it was difficult to tell uphill from down in many places and slope steepness was hard to judge. This led to the mistake of being on this slope. 

 

From looking at the map earlier in the tour, I had planned to be up out of the creek bottom and onto a north facing bench sooner, But with very few visual clues and the intense snowfall rate, I had missed this turn. As we were skinning up the drainage, I noticed the slope get steeper but struggled to plan the track due to the flat light. I could see some brush ahead and misestimated the slope angle between myself and the brush. As I climbed towards it, it became too steep to skin that direction so I stopped to kick turn to my right. As I completed my kick turn I heard a loud crack and the slope started to move. 

 

As I had already changed direction my ski started to turn downhill and I was able to stay *mostly* on top of the debris. My partner, who was still facing uphill as the slide started, was sucked backwards, skis pulling under. I yelled for him to swim right as I was getting ready to go over the top of him. Luckily, the slope angle had gently backed off and the slide started to slow. When the snow stopped moving, I was able to take off skis and stand up. My partner was partially buried, waist deep with his head facing uphill, but downhill from his skis. His skis were under enough snow that I had to dig them out to release his bindings. 

 

The maximum crown depth was three feet, and averaged around 18 inches. Crown was 45-50 feet wide and total slide distance from crown to toe was about 60 feet. The wind slab was very cohesive and stayed in large blocks through the avalanche. It entrained a shocking amount of snow for the size. The crown was on a slope angle of 35 degrees, and broke about 5 feet above us, right at a convex roll. The angle of the slope at the toe was 20 degrees. 

 

We were very lucky that this happened on a slope with overall convexity with the slope angle backing off gently. Many places in the creek bottom we we're traveling through had sharp concave sections that could easily have been terrain traps. I am disappointed that I underestimated the amount of snow that had been loading in this zone over the previous days. Being fairly low elevation and in a tight drainage I mistakenly thought that the area hadn't seen much wind. I am also disappointed that I failed to recognize the windslab, and mistook it for a supportable crust. I don't think I had on my ""avalanche eyes"" at this point due to complacency and ease of travel. Had I been paying better attention to the route, and doing small checks of the snow along the way, I may have seen earlier signs of slab. One pole was lost, overall a very cheap lesson.

I skied some steepish lines in pretty deep/thick trees, and then on my exit on a pretty open, west/NW facing slope saw that there appeared to be a decent-sized slide that I guessed had been triggered earlier in the day by skiers, since it wasn't fully blown-over with new snow and there were a good handful of tracks nearby.  With a decent slope on the other side there must have been some good opportunity for snow transport up and over the ridge, and the strength/swirliness of the wind probably created a slab on the lee side slope, which is probably not much of a frequent flier because it's normally fronting the typical prevailing winds; it's understandable that this could be misread today.  There wasn't a distinct crown so it was shallow, the debris wasn't deep, and there were no obstacles in the way, but it ran a long way and was a bit sobering nonetheless.  This will probably heal fairly quickly, but exposed zones could still be pretty triggery on Thursday, though for sure some exposed terrain may have snow windblasted into place....but on which aspects?  The wind seemed to be coming from every which way as it started to fade out in the afternoon.

I've never seen a slide path in the canyon before in the 5 years I've lived in it. Snow depth is around 2-3 feet on those slopes and it looks to have broke near the ground, probably 18"" crown or so with a 100+ foot width. The slope angle is 40+ degrees on these slopes, so a very steep angle. 

 

This is notable because during the winters this area is an active one for bow hunters, I've regularly seen them on these aspects hiking in the snow. The runout was around 500 feet through a few terrain traps. There's still a lot of snow on the northerly aspects below 6k feet, hikers and hunters need to be aware. Unclear what triggered this slide, possibly a large animal, we have a few herd of deer around. 

 

 

Forecaster Notes:  Thank you for the report- we have seen a few other animal triggered (?) slides in the foothills this winter (Big Cottonwood, Ogden). We went to look at this avalanche on February 20th. It stood out as unique and we wanted to see what the lower elevation snowpack looked like prior to the next storm.  This avalanche was most likely triggered by a deer on a layer of rounding facets above a melt freeze crust. It averaged 12"" deep, 18"" at the deepest on a 35 degree slope. The avalanche was 30' wide and between the 2 slides ran about 300' down the slope. It was difficult to see the debris as it dispersed into the trees.  I believe this was from an easterly canyon wind that cross loaded the slope. We did not go to the crown face as there were  cracks above the crown and not worth the risk.

We (party of 4) were climbing to gain the ridge between Yellow Jacket Trees and Cabin Run and ended up higher than we intended and missed the safer entrance to the ridge. None of us had done this approach before. We could see skyline through the trees and decided that two of our party would wait a safe distance back in the trees while two of us checked out the entrance onto the ridge. The two that continued realized that we were high as soon as we popped out of the trees and briefly talked about options, including going back down into the trees and retreating lower. However, the top of the ridge was one good kick turn away and we got sucked into that ""it’s so close” trap.

As my partner took some steps toward the top of the ridge I actually backed away even further and started getting pretty nervous but only said, “be careful, that looks wind loaded.” My partner was focused on a cornice on his left until he said, “oh, this is where the wind is dropping all the snow”. I had turned around and yelled to our other members to “not come up here”. I had decided we really should retreat, but I was too late and my partner yelled “slide”, and I turned back and saw the wind slab below the ridge break all around him. I tried to ski out to the side as I was on the very edge of where it propagated, but it hit me almost immediately. It broke probably 25’ wide and ran 50-60’; enough to take both of us for a short ride. My partner stopped at a tree probably 20’ down and I stopped at a tree 30’ down.

No burial, and no injuries besides a bruise. We did lose some poles. Once we determined everyone was ok we retreated and had a good debriefing and discussion of the traps we fell into.

Things we did right were space our party out as we became unsure of the route and terrain.

Things we did wrong were not turn around when we realized we had not approached the ridge the way we had intended. We knew we were in the wrong place, but got sucked into the feeling that it was just “right there”. The cornice drew our awareness away from the lower soft wind slab deposited below the ridge. Also, things can happen so quickly. Decisions can be made without fully understanding you are making them. Our group had a good dynamic and good communication generally, but in this moment we just didn’t take enough time. By the time I had processed my discomfort with the danger of continuing onto the ridge, it was too late. I needed to speak up immediately and more clearly. We should have returned and told the other two of our party the situation. I’m certain that would have changed our forward momentum and given us the time to make a better decision. We had been in pretty benign terrain all day, and had intended to keep it that way, but it only took 30 seconds for that to get away from us.

What is unusual about this avalanche is that our deep snowpack is opening up lots of terrain that ordinarily wouldn't be accessible in average snowpack years.

I intentionally ski cut the middle Race Start, skiing left towards the spur between middle and upper. The whole middle bowl ripped from the top and luckily I planned my ski cut well enough. The slope shattered around me but I was easily able to ski 15 feet left to safety on the spur.

SNOWPACK AND STORM SUMMARY:  The snowpack in the lower canyon (Blue Cut and down canyon) had a shallow snowpack through most of the winter.  This shallow snowpack developed faceted sugary grains throughout most of the snowpack.  By late February/early March, there was a slab starting to build on top of the weak basal layers.  A very warm and wet storm moved in on March 10 bringing 6 to 8 inches of new dense wet snow.  This alone was not enough to initiate natural avalanches.  The warm temperatures (and possibly a period of rain on snow) caused the entire pack to go isothermal which weakened the faceted snow and initiated the avalanches.

Temperatures stayed warm through the 12th with some additional precipitation.  More natural avalanches released on the 11th and 12th.

A second very warm and wet storm moved in on the 15th with rain on snow in the lower canyon.  This caused another round of natural avalanches.

The combination of both these warm wet storms produced the most significant avalanche cycle that we've seen in Huntington Canyon since 2017.

Snow felt very stable until we reached the ridge where some windblown snow was coated with a layer of graupel. From the ridge we set the remaining boot pack to the top of rainbow peak. Along the way, the top 4 inches of new snow showed signs of instability (cracking, blocking) on the windward side of the ridge. Knowing there would be a good chance of a wind slab over graupel on Rainbow Peak chute I cut the top of the slope. This cut released an avalanche that slide the entire length of the chute. After cutting the slope I entered a island of safety to the right of the slope as the avalanche passed by. Only once the slide settled did I continue cautiously to the bottom.
 

I think this episode shows the importance of identifying zones of safety before riding through avalanche terrain and cutting the top of a slope before entering the terrain below. While zones of safety and slope cuts are NOT a solution in avalanche terrain they do play a small part in mitigating risks. Please ride safely out there.

The initial release was a small wind slab at the ridge, and when it traveled down slope it released this larger pocket, failing on a graupel layer. This type of avalanche was ubiquitous around the range on many aspects above 8500'. There was evidence of another similar slide up higher in the drainage just below the headwall on the east facing slopes of the East Twin in Mary Ellen Gulch. This slide was remote triggered over 300m away due to mitigation work in the neighboring drainage of Mineral Basin (48 hours prior). There was also buried debris all throughout the drainage. The natural cycle, and ensuing AE and AS triggered avalanches during and following the week's storm is impressive. A truly widespread problem in the technical sense of the word.

Slide appears to have run 150 ft and 250 ft wide. Lower 1/2 of this slope mellows to 25 degrees then gradually flat, so the avy just ran out of juice. I have not seen this slope slide more than the top 1/2. There was heavy wind loading past 2 days and the snowpack here just hit its tipping point.

 

Overall area was getting slabby and very sensitive, cracks were noted on most of skin up, but only shooting 3-5 ft max.

We skied The Spire trees and on our way out spotted this natural. It seemed to have gone today, but may have been yesterday after snowfall ceased. I suspect that today's sun/wind caused a piece of the massive cornices above this to break and triggered this avalanche. In a photo I circled what looked like where the cornice gouged through the snow. As near as I could tell, the crown was 4-5'. It looks like the bed surface is the new/old snow interface before the beginning of last week's storm(s). Active loading today on this slope as winds continued to ramp up.  
It looks to have run .25 miles and approx. 700 vert. ft. 

I saw the other reported large naturals. Sobering day and lots to think about as the next storm rolls in.

Report from KSL News. 

Around noon on Tuesday March 28th, we received a report of a snowcat triggered avalanche in the Morgan area which took the cat for a ride through a group of trees, overturning it in the processes and injuring a passenger. Details and location are still being sifted through, but bottom line... this was a close call for sure

Then we saw a west facing line that looked good. We knew it was above 30 degrees. We sent one skier down without incident. I was second and took a line a few yards away from the first skiers line. I saw a lower slope angle and thought I was taking a safer route. After my second turn I saw a shooting crack at my ski tip, fell, and was carried about 10 yards down slope. The lower angle slope was actually a wind loaded pillow. I wasn't buried, recovered just fine, and skied the rest of the way out.

We aim to learn from accidents like this and offer comments to help others avoid future accidents. All of us at the Utah Avalanche Center has had our own close calls and know how easy it is to make mistakes. Here are some take-a-ways from this accident:


	Both brothers carried an avalanche transceiver, shovel, and probe, along with airbag backpacks and radios for communication.
	Snowmobiles are very useful tools during an avalanche rescue because they allow someone to cover long distances quickly; however, they also cause electro-magnetic interference with transceivers. Identifying and mitigating this interference is crucial. The current recommendation is to be 3 meters away from a snowmobile when searching. They can be used in the signal search phase of a rescue, but you need to stop occasionally move 3 meters away from the snowmobile. If there is no signal, return to the sled and change locations.
	Avalanche airbags can limit burial depth but are much less effective in terrain traps. Additionally, terrain traps tend to cause deep burials because the avalanche debris often accumulates deeper than it would otherwise. Deep burials are very hard to survive.






	Avalanche probes are delicate pieces of equipment and most are generally less than 3 meters long. One piece of equipment the group found very valuable was a Pieps iProbe, an electronic probe that can detect a transceiver signal. Without having a probe strike for some time, this tool helped direct their digging efforts.






	Always only to expose one person to avalanche terrain at one time. It was very lucky in this case that both riders were not buried.

Snowbasin patrol observed this avalanche on their afternoon sweeps on Sunday April 9 , 2023.  This avalanche appears to have tracks in at the top and a potential track out with a skin track back up on the riders left side.  This avalanche ran 1.1 miles from line of sight from the ridgetop. 




Forecaster Comments: After originally posting this observation as skier triggered based on tracks in and not out. A party that skied this slope the day before checked in with Snowbasin Ski Patrol on Monday April 10th.

 

They had skied a portion of the slope prior to the avalanche and didn't like it so turned around and skinned back out.  That explains the tracks.

The UAC would like to thank Park City Powder Cats (PCPC) for sharing information about the timeline of the accident and allowing UAC staff access to the avalanche after the incident.

We aim to learn from accidents like this and offer comments to help others avoid future accidents. There were two factors that added challenges to this rescue:

One factor was that the skier who did not survive was buried deeply. Shoveling is the most demanding and time-consuming phase of a rescue which takes longer the deeper a person is buried.

The other factor was that there were two people buried. Rescue becomes more complex and more time consuming when there are multiple people buried by an avalanche.

Similar slopes nearby had some wind-loading and am guessing this slope was also wind-loaded. It also faces east which is a leeward aspect from the recent northwest winds.

 

The weak layer is a layer of lower-density snow just above the dust crust. I found this weak layer on Thursday in the Catherine's Pass Area, and it is apparently still reactive as other avalanches reported from Saturday are also failing on this weak layer. 

 

We found no other signs of instability such as cracking and it seems you need a denser slab with some wind-loading to make this weak layer reactive.
